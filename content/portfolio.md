## jluna: A Julia Wrapper for C++

Available <a href="https://github.com/Clemapfel/jluna" target="_blank">here</a>, under MIT License.

Comprehensive wrapper around the <a href="https://julialang.org" target="_blank">Julia</a> C-API, includes automated memory-management, exception
safety, convenient linking. Allows for native C++ code interacting with the Julia state from within a thread, even 
though this  is currently impossible in the pure Julia C-API. Thread-safe, parallelized, fast, well-tested & stable.

Includes hand-written, step-by-step guide and documentation.

Feature-complete, version 0.9 will be upgraded to 1.0 in Winter 2022.

Available <a href="https://github.com/Clemapfel/crisp" target="_blank">here</a>, under MIT License.

A library demonstrating my expertise in image- and audio-processing techniques, written from scratch. Supports GPU-side
computation, 32bit HDR colors, spectral techniques, automated segmentation, deep-learning based feature classification.
Verbose, hand-written documentation.

## Telescope: A 2D Game Engine

Available <a href="https://github.com/Clemapfel/telescope" target="_blank">here</a>, under GPLv3.

<a href="https://github.com/jhigginbotham64" target="_blank">Commissioned</a>, but mostly designed and implemented by me. Includes a simplified,
yet functionally equivalent wrapper around Box2D, opengl-based primitives, sound- and music-management. Comes with a
syntax-equivalent Julia binding, implemented using an internal C interface for interoperability.

Planned features: real-time audio processing, shaders-interface, 2d lighting engine

Provides tutorial and automatically generated documentation, written by me. The latter uses <a href="https://doxygen.nl" target="_blank">Doxygen</a> for inline documentation, 
translated to <a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html" target="_blank">rst</a> using
