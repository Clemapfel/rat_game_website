## mousetrap: Julia GUI Engine

Available <a href="https://github.com/Clemapfel/mousetrap.jl" target="_blank">here</a>, under lGPL3-0 license.

Fully featured, cross-platform wrapper around GKT4, heavily reworks the interface from scratch in order to facilitate usage by users unfamiliar with GUI programming. Includes a gobject-based reference counting mechanism, which is independent of the Julia garbage collection, and a OpenGL rendering engine, written from scratch.

The library consists of a <a href="https://clemens-cords.com/mousetrap_cpp" target="_blank">C++ back-end</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/clemapfel/mousetrap_julia_binding" target="_blank">C++ to Julia interface</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/clemapfel/mousetrap_linux_jll" target="_blank">BinaryBuilder wrapper</a>, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/clemapfel/mousetrap.jl" target="_blank">actual Julia package</a>.

Extensive documentation, including a <a href="https://clemens-cords.com/mousetrap" target="_blank">complete manual</a> which aids users in learning the library and GUI programming in general.

Currently in Beta, v0.1.0 as of August 2023.
