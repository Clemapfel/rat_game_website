## Motivation

Let's start this personally because everything that will be touched on is very personal to myself. So I was talking to a friend and I showed them the following screenshot of omori which is a very succesfull indie game however they did not know this, the picture was completely out of context. Their reaction was stronger than I anticipated: "Looks neat but man I just get the vibe it's a generic JRPG in a cool package". I intuitively asked myself two question: i) why do they think this is a jRPG and ii) why would seeing a jRPG that looks this warrant comparison to a weird set of games that are all so similar they have a bad reputation for being shallow yet good-looking?

## Definition and Examples

In this piece I will introduce a term for a genre of game that sounds like it's
 been long-established but on further examination a selective subset of what people would consider a jRPG. "Earthbound-like" refers to a game that has the following properties:
 
- It's graphics are predominantly 2D, sprite-based, 3rd person
- It has at least one of two modes of interacting with the world: 
    - In the "overworld" a character can moves around using basic movement in a tile-based world. There they can interact with entities in basic ways like talking to them, triggering switches or getting rid of roadblocks.  
    - In the "battles" the point of view switches compared to the overworld (usually head-on) and the will participate in a turn-based battle with at least one party member and at least one enemy
    
As you may notice these are also the properties of all jRPGs so why do I need a new gerne then? Answering this is somewhat tricky because it's a "you know one if you see one" type of definition so instead declaring the lowest common denominator right away let me give you a non-exhaustive lists of all games I consider earthbound-likes:
+ The Mother Series (Mother 1, Earthbound, Mother 3)
+ Mario RPG, Paper Mario 64, Paper Mario: TTYD, Mario & Luigi: Super Star Saga, Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time, Mario & Luigi: Bowsers Inside Story 
+ Every commercially released RPG-Maker including Yumei-Niiki and it's spin-offs, LISA series, To the Moon, OFF, omori, Escaped Chasm, Suits: a Business RPG, .flow, IB, Dreaming Mary, The Witch's House, Misere*
+ Undertale and it's sequels
+ One Shot*, Escaped Chasm, Mother 4* (the fan game), Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass, Dujanah, Hylics, Lakeview Valley*, Golf Story*, Ghost Hospital*, 

(names marked with an * are games I have not yet played myself)

The intention of this paper is to find what unites these games and discuss that in detail however before we take them on one-at-a-time I would like to add two properties to the above definition:  
- The biggest appeal of the the game is it's story or presentation, not the gameplay
- If it is made by an independent studio (and not just 1 person) not associated with a mainstream publisher, that studio is located in the western world
- their settings can be described as surreal and/or quirky and endearing
- If the game has turn-based battles there is a "twist" to them, like adding mechanics from a different genre or tieing the usually D&D-simulating combat into the setting

Now that you know what games I'm talking about I would like to start to look at the history of the genre as I think every game on this list can be traced back to a very small set of games that inspired them. Also: yes, every earthbound-like can also be considered jRPG, however the inverse is not the case. Also also I am not trying to promote the term "earthbound-like", it simply is what I will call them in this piece and in fact the validity of having a specific genre for these is very much in question.

## History
### Earthbound

#### Raving About Earthbound for a Bit
As the term may implay, all earthbound-likes are like - well - earthbound. Earthbound is an SNES game that was
released in late 1990 and that was by all metrics a failure, Japan kinda liked it but in the US a really wierd
marketing campaing based on foul-smelling stickers TODO: cite along with an above-average price of the cartridge
because it came with a guide book ensured that Mother 2: Earthbound was a commercial disaster to the point where
PAL regions didn't even get a version at all. My personal history with Earthbound was as predicted: I've never
heard of it and went back to emulate it around 2013 and it went on to change my life as it did with many others. 
Back then (that is in 2010 but in 1990 especially) Earthbound was special and unlike anything else. It looked
like a regular final-fantasy rip-off jRPG but it didn't feel like one. First the setting was... western? It
didn't try to emulate any specific culture but there's burger shops and traveling jazz roadshows and police
and arcades and baseball bats, etc., it was unlike anything Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest which at that point
(and arguably today) were the defining trends in first-party jRPGs. Along-side a fresh take on urban america
Earthbound was also unapologetically weird. I think that's why the US Marketing team focused on those weird
smelly stickers, one boss is literally a pile of vomit, to get to his dungeon you have to wait behind a
waterfall for an real-life-time hour, way-blocks that would be a rock or a tree in any other game are a
metal pencil-shaped statue and to get rid of the roadblock you use - what else - a pencil eraser. I've been just
 listing things in the game but I really can't overstate how weird and unusual everything in terms of setting was
 . The story itself was farely standard, young boy gets magical powers and goes on a heros journey to prevent big
evil bad from ending the world. But even with this Earthbound did something extra, the last boss "Gigyas" is not
really a villain, it's a non-corporeal entity of pure evil. It feels more like a force of nature than any specific
individual and it's boss fight (the last of the game) is famously traumatizing. In summary earthbounds setting and story
may not be good by objective standards but it is definitely objectively weird and unlike many other things. Pair this
 with what is one of the video game soundtracks every conceived (especially for SNES hardware) and decent-ish pixel art
 and you have a game that even though it failed it's first attempt at having an impact did so 20 years later.
 
#### Earthbounds Battle System
About 30% of your play-time of Earthbound is spend battling and I'd like to focus in on this because it provides a good 
baseline with which to compare every other battle system in this paper. While Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy usually 
just emulate D&D dice-rules earthbound has 2 gimmicks. The first gimmick is that it's weird an obtuse, there's status
 ailments like having a runny nose or becoming infected with a parasitic mushroom that inverts you button. None of
these status effects add any depth to the combat in my opinion what they do add though is flavor. The other gimmick
is the back-of-the-box features, the thing every video essayist names when talking about the battle system the
"rolling health meter". It works like this: When you take damage your 3-digit health starts ticking down at a fixed
rate relative to the games framerate. For example if you have 800 health and take 900 damage your health starts
ticking down but the battle continues, if you manage to heal for 100 health while the meter is at 250 the meter
stops and you will be at 350 HP after healing. Surface level analysis would show that this system is "better" than
just a plain Dragon Quest system of crits and selecting attacks with the A button because it adds depth, suddenly time
is also a factor in battle and this increases tension. I would argue that the rolling health meter is clumsy, for
example as stated it rolls at a speed relative to the framerate of the game which means that while an enemy is
doing an attack, while your allies animations are playing out, while the battle log is scrolling, the health meter
keeps rolling down. All of these factors are out of your control so saying that the health meter adds
singnificant complexity is a fraily weak statement in my opinion. Effectively the rolling health meter makes it so 
a non-zero number of times the player will frantically try to menu and save themself just in time which creates
a positive memory and just by this metric it is worth the inclusion in my opinion, however as states I consider
this features a gimmick and much like the weird status effects and enemy designs add flavor, not complexity. I
would like to restate this because it is in my opinion an almost omni-present feature of earthbound-likes
: Non turn-based Additions to the battle system are meant to add complexity but end up adding flavor more
than anything else.  
Overall Earthbound is a good game, I am not here to review earthbound but what I am here is to illustrate it's
influence and much like 2013-me was playing earthbound on an emulater during breaks between college classes an
entire                     if (left_x != 0)
generation of jRPG fans had let Earthbound make a significant live-long impression on them and if nothing else 
I commend any game that holds that power. 

### RPG Maker 

In late 2000 a mere 10 years after earthbound and another 10 before it's resurfacing into the mainstream RPG Maker
was created. Intended as 50% engine and 50% development tool it boiled down what makes a jRPG to the point where
anyone can now create one by simply clicking together elements and adding in a few sprites. I sound facetious but
let me state something clearly right now: RPG Maker is an overwhelming good force on this genre and games in
general. RPG Maker to jRPGS what Flash was to Animators, suddenly people with barely any IT education
could and no ressources other than some time could create games, on their own, and the games are actual games
. RPG Maker was and mostly still is somewhat primitive however. Before we continue and talk about great games
made in RPG Maker, I would like to critique a lot of the things RPG Maker brings with them as those will also
be applicable for any game made in it:
Games run at a window size equal to it's native resolution. What this means is that 1 pixel in a sprite in rpg
maker is the size of 1 pixel on your physical monitor. As pixel art demands a low native resolution this means rpg
maker games take place in a window in the center of the screen. As monitors increase in size and resolution this will
just get worse and worse and is honestly the main issue why this scene of games is a niche thing. Similarly RPG
Maker games have terrible performance. A game that may displays 50 tiny sprites moving on screen will
drain the battery of your laptop like you're mining bitcoins. 
RPG Maker prohibits users from commercially releasing a game that has made substantial modifications to their
engine. While I get the idea behind this (basically they don't want to make it open source but they also don't want
to be held liable when someone writes malware) this fact is incredibly limiting when you think about it. While the
"skill" floor has ben push way down to the point were anyone can now create a jRPGs the corresponding ceiling has
been nailed down just above ground level and has been legally required to never raise above it. Simply put you
can't do anything in RPG maker, you can only make a very specific game with a very specific set of features. It
has to be tile-based, it has to light puzzles or turn-based combat, it has to 2D top down, etc.. To put it
blunty, RPG Maker is empowering, but it is also incredibly limiting. Not too limiting however to not make
great games so let's talk about some of those.

#### Yumei Nikki

Yumei Nikki was released by the highly emblematic "Kikiyama", the games name in japanese translates to "dream diaries" 
and while it's a very odd game I am of the opinion it is one of the most influential games of all time. Yumei Nikki
was made in a really old version RPG Maker but it has no abstract jRPGs battles even though they are trivial to implement
using the engine. Instead Yumei Nikki is what some may today call a walking simulator, you explore a set of vast worlds, 
visually distinct from each other but verys same-y within themself. Interaction with the environment happens through 
"costumes", collectable items you can pick up and equip that may just change the sprite of the player character or may
interact with other objects like a knife to attack certain enemies. Other TODO: JORDAN UNDER VIDEO have done great
at describing the game and what is appealing about it in more detail than I have time for here but I'd like to highlight 
a few specific things with it. In Yumei Nikki you play as a girl that is confirmed to be a Hikikomori, a young adult that
refuses to leave their room. In game you start in this room and to access the different worlds you use the titular dream
journal. This frames the worlds enviornment as being liminal and inherently surreal but also as a product of the main
characters psychology. In one world you can see a car crash victims body, lying on the street bleeding out and while
there is neither dialogue nor much in the way of interaction the framing of the game cements this imagery as a 
surreal representation of trauma of the main character and as Madotsuki (that's her name) is basically a blank slate 
it is reasonable to project that trauma onto the dev themself. The car crash scene moves the goalpost in a way where
now every single element of the mostly non-sensical world can now be interpreted and projected and I think that 
along with the trance-like experience of walking around surreal beautiful but highly repeptitious worlds with no
goal or purpose other than to see more is why theres a giant fan community around the game. I cannot overemphasize 
how huge this game is in certain circles, every character in the game be it important like the car crash victim or 
the almost main-stream famous TODO: SCARY DUDE THAT HAPPENS RANDOMLY all the way to irrelevant window-dressing characters
that are functionally equivalent to decoration but through the games framing and art become something anthromorpized 
in the audiences mind. Yumei Nikki is a very strange game, it has no relating to jRPGs other than also being seen through a 2d sprite-based 
tiled top down perspective and being made in RPG Maker but through being so strange and endearing it has become an 
influence on a whole generation of indie-devs. 

So starting with this paragraph I will highlight one or two properties of the games that were in the future (spoilers)
inherited by any earthbound-like that came after. If Earthbound is the Super Metroid then Yumei Nikki is the Castlevania
of the Metroidvania genre (note how I decided against the more obvious dark-souls comparison where earthbound is the dark souls 
and yumei nikki is the bloodborne of the soulsborne gen- ah fuck I did the dark souls comparison anyway fml). What I want you
take from this paragraph is this: What made earthbound special was it's quirkyness, it's uniqueness and how it iterated 
on jRPGs as a whole not by improving anything but be adding spice. Earthbound has a very literal story, there's not
many themes or big-ideas but there doesn't need to be when the world is this interesting and endearing. Yumei Nikki
has almost no mechanical gameplay, experiencing the game is experiencing the feeling, the liminal suggestions that 
barely reach your conscious as you wander around this surreal world. Earthbound can be surreal too like in moonside
but Yumei Nikki is "oops, all surrealism". Yumei Nikki is also (if intentionally or not) expressionist. Through framing
to the tiny amount of plot and being increadibly interpretable Yumei Nikki feels like a game made not to be entertaining
but to project ideas the developer had into the world in an almost unfiltered way while still being vague enough plot- 
and lore wise that what exactly is being communicated entirely depends on the audience. What we can be sure of however
is that what Yumei Nikkis world is trying to express is extremely personal, and most likely not to Madostuki but personal
to whoever made the game. 

#### OFF

OFF is another RPG maker game made by a basically anonymous person in a foreign country: France this time instead of 
Japan. OFF is not as influential or iconic as earthbound or Yumei Nikki but I'd still like to talk about here for what 
makes OFF relevant to the earthbound-like genre is not the game itself but the process of how it was created. I'd like
to show you two screenshots from OFF, hopefully without context. Try to only look at the first, read what I wrote and 
then look at the second:

TODO: screenshot of outside world

I think even a layman would instantly recognize that this is a RPG-Maker game. It's very basic, just solid colors 
and an overworld sprite so bland you could be forgiven if you think it was made as a placeholder. This is what OFF 
the game is. It is by all measurements a terrible game. The puzzles are terrible, the movement feels terrible (though 
this may be to blame the outdated version of RPG Maker the dev used), the dialogue is horrendous but I will touch on 
that later and yet still while I was playing of and being perplexed at how sub-standard a game can be to still garner 
such a big following something happened. I never forgot OFF. I kept thinking about and there's two reasons for that. 
The first and most obvious reason is the follow: (please consider watching this video for a few seconds as the music
is important to my point here).

TODO: OFF battle theme

It looks completely unique, it looks hand-drawn, doodled almost and that is because it was. The dev literally drew the 
characters on paper TODO: link and scanned them and put them in the game like that. He didn't use the drawings as a base
they literally scanned in the paper, sized it down to the resolution RPG maker wants and that's it. Now this might not 
be totally true but what I'm trying to say is that the games graphic give you that feeling. It seizes to be immersive
and instead displays the process of how it was made openly and unapologetically. This is also true for the dialogue, 
at best the dialogue can be awkward but at worst it can be incrompehensible. The reason for this I assume is because 
the game was first released in french. Many young french people have a substandard graps on the english language because
of what I assume are systemic reasons. Either way the dialogue feels like it's badly translated, not because it is 
wrong but because cadence, word-choice and nonsensical idioms are omnipresent. This goes for names and locations and
everything really. This again, can force the audience to interact with the process of how the game was created. It 
was one person, in france, who can't speake english very well who can't do pixelart either (as obvious from how all 
pixel-only graphics are very simplistic while the more intersting parts of the games artwork are all scanned-in irl 
drawings or prints) and who most likely can't programm very well weither. The games battle system is the bog-standard rpg 
maker system, the dev didn't even bother to implement more characters the other party members other than the main 
character with the baseball bat are just incorporeal circles. You wouldn't know this by just visuals but the battles
are completely imbalanced, there is no strategy you just click one of the like 5 moves there are in total. Puzzles in 
the overworld are often find-the-way-through-a-maze or remember-a-number-combination-and-punch-it-in-somehwere else. 
This all presented in the RPG-maker typical tiny window with bad font and the simplest movement system you can imaging 
(it's literaly Gen1 Pokémon) and OFF should have been a failure yet it wasn't. Financially it probably was but culturally
to this day there's a big community around the game, people cosplay as most of the characters and even I who probably 
sounded very dismissive of the game in this paragraph can still positiely say it had a huge impact on me and I will never
forget it. 
What OFF (and many other games like SUITS (which is a game were literally all graphics are scanned-in doodles) and many
other RPG Maker games) brings to the earthbound-like genetic lineage in my opinion is focus on the process of creating 
the game. If people play Resident Evil or Final Fantasy they don't think about the people who made the sprite, how many
people worked on it or where the game is from. The experience the game on it's own terms and while OFF may have tried 
in the end it doesn't do this. It exposes itself much like a Jackson Pollocks painting in a way where the impression 
it leaves on the audience is very intense by not only offering a compelling audio-visual experience (OFF has great music
btw) but by making the audience engaging with it not as an experience or product but as someones work. "A single person 
made this, I can see how they made it" and even if the process itself is simplistic or flawed that does not mean
the game cannot have an enourmous impact on whoever experiences it.

(right now I'd like to point out a very specific thing. Much like TODO in Yumei Nikki who can only be encountered through
very obscure means OFF has a character called "Rebecca Sugar" which has their own battle theme and it's basically a 
hidden boss and in my experience the only challenging part of the game. Keep this in mind, this trend of "Super Hard 
obscure Character that had way too much effort put into them for how few people will see it during their playthrough")

#### Super Mario RPG, Super Star Saga and Paper Mario 64

Taking a break from the no-budget indie games I'd like to circle back to a first-party game that had all the funding in 
the world and matching success. In 1996 Nintendo joined forces with the at that point incredibly critically acclaimed
square who was just fresh of Final Fantasy 6, one if not the best jRPG of all time to use their lovable plumber in a...
turn-based battle system. Mario is about jumping and I think the devs new that and in response they had an ingenious idea. 
First of they also had a bad idea which was that in the overworld you can jump around. If you want to pick up an item you 
instead have to jump on a block, etc.. Getting that bad idea out of the way they created on of the in my opinion best 
mechanics ever implemented for a turn-based game: action commands. Instead of just menu'ing and hitting A you have to
time your a-press in what could be described as a quick-time even nowadays. The QTE is completely diagetic, there's no 
"hit A now" instead you have to time for example mario landing on top of an enemy as close to the enemies head as possible.
If you do it really well you get rewarded with extra damage or effects, if you do it badly the attack may fail completely
and if you do kinda decently you get kinda decent damage. Not only does the QTE affect the numbers but a different 
animation triggers. There's a power in the game that was carried over to Super Mario 64 (the games spritiual sequel in 
2.5d on N64 this time) where if you hit the QTE of jumping on someone perfectly you get to jump another time, and then 
again, and again and everytime it gets a tigher input then the last until finally it's frame-perfect. If you hit that 
input however it just keeps going and speedrunners use this to effortlessly steamroll through bosses doing literally 
100 jumps in succession and an appropriate amount of damage. Apart from this system (which is not only active on
attacking btw, defending, spells, almost everything works like this) the game is a fairly standard jRPGs. A mana-equivalent,
a potion-equivalent, roaming enemies that if you run into them a battle starts, banging music, the works. However what 
makes this game adjacent to an Earthbound-like is it's world an story. Once again it operates on an extremely 
literal level displaying a very odd, quirky world that is not taking itself serious whatsoever like final fantasy 
but that is more fleshed out and in some ways adult than a regular mario game. Before expressing what this game 
brought to the lineage I'd like to talk about it's spiritual sequels, on game boy advance in 2003 there was 
"Mario & Luigi: Super Star Saga", one of the best looking pixel art games of all time and a game that was written so well
that it gave Bowser a personality that endures to this day. It had a completely unique universe that instead of being
mushroom-themed was bean theme, some enemies kinda looked like mario ones but there were also completely unique enemies, 
characters, it was an explosion of personality and creativity rarely afforded to first-party mario games. 

TODO: Wine boss

Super Star Sagas combat iterated on Mario RPGs by instead of just requiring pressing the A button for QTEs also pressing 
B button which sounds super standard until you hear that A exclusively controls mario and B exclusively controls Luigi.
So if an enemy spits two fire balls slightly apart and the first one hits mario and the second one hits luigi the player
will have to defend first with A then with B. If moves hit both of them this can get very challenging and similarly 
QTEs in the overworld along with powers used for navigation also follow the "A for mario, B for luigi" principle. It's 
an ingenious way of controlling 2 characters on a system that had the same amount of buttons as the NES. 
Paper Mario 64 may have been a huge shift in looks but in gameplay it is nearly identical. Again the QTE system carries
the combat and makes these games appealing to people who don't like jRPGs because "there's finally gameplay in the 
battles, you guys". Also like Super Star Saga and Mario RPG before it Paper Mario 64 has a wholly unique world, new 
enemies new bosses some like what we've seen from other mario games some unlike anything we've seen. Even between these
three games the worlds rarely share characters, each one reinvents the wheel of the setting and major characters and 
all three nail it effortlessly. 
Which trait did the Supar Mario RPG Series (no I won't talk about the current year sequels) bring to the lineage? To 
put it simply, they added gameplay where there was none. I may have misrepresented the games a bit by using the word QTE
but it really doesn't feel like one, battling is a mechanical challenge. Navigating the overworld is a mechanical challenge,
so is solving puzzles. It doesn't feel like any of the games mentioned here already because many people would 
consider the series almost action games. I also think that this is why many people who would hate Final Fantasy 6 love
Paper Mario 64. It's bright, it's quirky and not only does it break with tradition in terms of setting but also 
mechanically and I think they way Nintendo and Square bridged that gap already on the SNES was simply genius.

I'd like to qualify something, actually. I personally do not agree with the saying that pure jRPGs Battles "have no gameplay"
however my problem with this is a semantic one. More accurately put, pure jRPGs Battles "have no reflex challenges". 
Playing Earthbound there is very little happening in the players hands, maybe they try to menu a bit faster because of the
rolling health but that's it. Playing a Mario RPG every attack, ever move an enemy works is inherently linked to a mechanical
challenge much akin to jumping in a traditional mario game. A good jRPG does have gameplay, it just happens in the 
players head, strategizing, waiging options, instead of their hands. The keen eyed among you may have already guessed 
what I'm going to say next: Earthbound really doesn't have gameplay, be it mental or reflex-based. Yumei Nikki does not 
have gameplay, OFF does not have gameplay. These games are both mechanically and intellectually very simple. This of 
course doesn't make them bad games at all. What it result in however is that it makes them niche games. Most of the gaming
audience does not want to play a game like that and I think that's part of threason this lineage of games is surrounded 
by a subculture that's this tightly knit. Anyone who likes Yumei Nikki already exhbiti a large amount of patience and 
willingless to engage with a game that is not challenging whatsoever and I think that precisely because of this the 
 Mario RPG Series is so pivotal. It's a jRPG, it has a quirky and creative world, it does not engage with very head-y 
 concepts, it's highly visually appealing and it's writing is sharp and playful. Just this time it's also actually fun 
 for your hands. From here on in the lineage earthbound-likes feel like they have to do more. Just rpg maker combat is 
 seen as suboptimal and is objectively suboptimal if you're trying to 
 reach a bigger market. Mario RPG solved a problem that was only this pronounced in earthbound-likes: battles and walking
 around can be fun - even for normal people.
 
#### The Gimmick

"The gimmick" is not a game, in my opinion it is a feature of earthbound-likes. With Mario RPG as a benchmark you 
can't just have a jRPG. You need to have something on top of that, I will call this "the gimmick" however I am not 
fully satisfied with the connotations of that so I'd like to expand on what I feel about this. The cynical part of me
thinks "earthbound-likes don't know how to make combat interesting and complex. They used to get away with that but
now they need a gimmick on top to not be a terrible game". This is not true, however I do think that a lot of devs 
create their games as if this were true.
