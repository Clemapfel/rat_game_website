## 1. Motivation

I want to start this piece on a personal note, I was casually talking to a friend and I opened the conversation by showing them the following screenshot of a "omori" (which is by all accounts a very good game) completely out of context:

<center>
<img src="https://robots.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Combat.jpg" alt="Omori Battle Scene">
<br><b>Figure 1.0</b>: <i>Battle Scene from {{<external href="http://www.omori-game.com/" text="Omori"/>}} that I showed to my friend.</i>
</center>

I just thought it looks nice, right? Their reaction was a lot stronger than I anticipated: "Looks neat but man I just get the vibe it's a generic western jRPG in a cool package".
I poked further and they went on to elaborate that they feel it's just another one of "those" games, midly disturbing subject matter, quirky world, shallow jRPG combat and an amazing visual presentation. I do not necessarily agree with any of these and obviously m friend hasn't played the game so I wouldn't even consider it their opinion, really, but even after the conversation went on I kept thinking about what they said. It implies that Omori is part of a lineage, that a out-of-context screenshot of it's battle system is enough evidence to not only know what game it is but to also judge it as so alike every other game in that lineage that it becomes generic and deals with very specific subject matter.

In this piece I will not argue for or against Omori or talk about it much at all, I won't disclose if I agree with my friend or if they changed their opinion after doing more research, rather I would like to neutrally examine how we got here and what exactly my friend was comparing Omori to.

### 1.1 Some Examples

</center>

As you may have guessed from the title, I will call the genre Omori is part of "Earthbound-likes". I think most will be familiar with the term "souls-like" which does have fairly clearly formulated properties <a href="#[1]">[1]</a> but for the sake of argument I will simply give a single line definition: "A souls-like game is a game that was inspired by Dark Souls". An Earthbounhd-like, then, is a game inspired by Mother 2: Earthbound, though much like with souls-likes it goes deeper than that. 
As I will aim to illustrate Earthbound-likes follow a very clear timeline and sequence of influences, Earthbound way first, then other games came that were inspired by only it and similarly to bloodborne for souls-like or castleania for metroidvanias, those subsequent became part of the genre identity. Hopefully by the end and as I name more and more games you yourself will form somewhat of a list of properties that make an earthbound-likes. Properties so specific that they do warrant to become a sub-genre themself. 

For now, here is a non-exhaustive, non-ordered list of games I consider Earthbound-likes:

+ The Mother Series (Mother 1, Mother 2: Earthbound, Mother 3)
+ Mario RPG (SNES), Paper Mario 64, Paper Mario: TTYD, Mario & Luigi: Super Star Saga, M&L: Bowsers Inside Story, M&L: Partners in Time
+ Most if not all of the commercially released RPG-Maker games, including but not limited to:

I think most people that are familiar with these games can already form a somewhat clear picture of what I mean when I say Earthbound-like but let's build my definition step by step, with the first step being, of course:

## 2 Earthbound
~~Earthbound is the Dark-Souls of ...~~ When Earthbound released it tanked in sales, became relatively obscure almost immediately and didn't even get a PAL import because Nintendo didn't want to bother. To this day Mother 3 which is objectively a great game and whos Protagonist is in Smash Bros still has not received official localization, that's how traumatic Earthbounds lack of success was to them. Many blamed this on the <a href="https://earthboundcentral.com/2010/03/earthbound-in-nintendo-power-73/" target="_blank">stink-based</a> advertising but I personally believe it was mostly due to the fact that the game was non-optionally bundled with a strategy guide thus raising the price above what similar games would've costed off the same shelf. Most children in 1994 weren't willing to take a risk and spend their entires years gaming-budget on a game actively marketed as super weird and unlike any other game they knew. 
That last point is not technically true however, Earthbound was a whole lot like it's prequel: Mother 1 for the NES (later released as <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/NES/EarthBound-Beginnings-1025416.html" target="_blank">Earthbound Beginnings</a> on the Nintendo Eshop. I don't want to dwell to deep on Earthbound history and Mother 1, there are <a href="https://earthboundcentral.com" target="_blank">entire websites</a> dedicated to it and this piece will already be long enough as is but what I want you to want to note here is that Earthbound wasn't iconic when it came out, no, it took some time to become iconic. I personally played the game for the first time in 2014 on an emulator however I was relatively late to the party most people who would eventually get *really* into Earthbound played it around the start of the 2000s.

</center>

So what made Earthbound special? Fo one it was a good game but I think what made it stand out is how unlike traditional jRPG <a href="#[2]">[2]</a> it really was. It was set in suburban america, you had to actually put your money into an ATM, enemies were rabid dogs, angry ducks, homeless people, three psychicly connected moles, full-sized dinosaurs, a guy that lives inside a dungeon and the dungeon is also a statue/robot that walks around, you get the idea. It's story was almost nonsensical, an episodic fever dream of walking around a surreal world erasing pencil-shaped roadblocks made out of metal and waiting behind a waterfall for 1h in real time to fight a literal pile of vomit. Earthbound was odd, quirky and - unlike it's advertising - incredibly charming. Pairing that good graphics even by todays standards and one of the best soundtracks in all of gaming and you get a cult classic. While all of these things are important, they only made up half of Earthbound gameplay.

### 2.1 Earthbounds Combat

<center>
<img src="https://lparchive.org/Earthbound/Update%2021/16-capture_03042008_100928.png
">
<br><b>Figure 2.1</b>: <i>Battle against a Moonside "Crazed [Street] Sign" in Earthbound.</i>
</center>

Like all traditional jRPGs, gameplay in Earthbound is in one of two states: in the "overworld" you walk around talking to people, maybe solving some puzzles. While in the overworld you can walk into (or otherwise interact with) an enemy (who may or may not be also trying to interact with you) to start a very... abstract representation of a battle. Instead of having a sense of place, Earthbound simply has static sprites floating in front of a 1994 SNES SFX-Chip-induced shader fever dream. Pairing this with the weird and unique enemy designs (c.f. Fig. 2.1) made for an extremely unusally <b>looking</b> battle system. What took place underneath that asthetic however was a very much like a traditional jRPG, one might maybe even call it generic; people usually don't feel that way when thinking about their memories with Earthbound though. This is for multiple reason: first the fact you're fighting all these crazy creatures really does inherently bring a lot of spice and memorability into battles. Along the Pokémon-esque rock-paper-scissor weakness-means-more-damage system Earthbound also includes a lot (and I mean "a lot" as in "too many") esoteric status ailments in a somewhat vain effort to add complexity. While there's traditional status' like being asleep, poisoned and burning there's also: having fleas, having a runny nose, feeling homesick, having a mushroom grow on you, feeling "strange", having a sunstroke. The actual <a href="https://earthbound.fandom.com/wiki/Status_Ailment" target="_blank">mechanical purpose</a> of these is fairly unclear and I think most player could not name the actual gameplay impact most of these have but that didn't really matter, much like the choice of setting and enemies the quirky status' added flavor rather than depth - which isn't a bad thing. It is fun to play a game on your SNES and find out mid-battle that your character can have a runny nose and miss a turn because they're sniffling and if for no other reason than this, all the status' were worth the inclusion in my opinion.

">
<br><b>Figure 2.1.1</b>: <i>Animated .gif showing the rolling health meter. (source: lparchive)</i>
</center>

Another often remember feature is the "rolling" health bar (c.f. Fig. 2.2). When loosing or gaining health, rather than instantly adding the given amount to the party-members healthbar it instead adds to it slowly and in real time. "Real time" meaning that while you menu or wait for attack animations to play out the health slowly "rolls" up or down. The intended emergent gameplay moment of this is for you take a huge hit that would ordinarily instantly kill your character and instead having the health roll down at rate that now incentivizes fast action, if you're quick enough (and you get lucky enough that the other animations aren't too long) you may be able to select a healing item at which point your health immediately starts rolling up instead, avoiding death. I think most player will have at least one moment like this and for that alone this system was worth the inclusion but I also think that much like the numerous weird status ailments it only provides the *illusion* of depth. If you were to replace the system with the traditional die-instantly way of taking damage you would would only need to redesign a single-digit number of encounters <a href="#[3]">[3]</a>ver an entire playthrough in order for them to go the exact same way, all that really changes is the potential emotional impact. I don't want to critique this system too much, I think it is a good system but much like the status ailments it's inclusion did not result in adding significant death, it resulted in adding flavor. I think it's important to recognize this and (spoiler alert) it will be a fundamental principle in games that followed in Earthbound footsteps.

#### 2.2 Giygas 

<center>

<br><b>Figure 2.1.2</b>: <i>Animated .gif showing the background texture and shader during the battle against Giygas. Note the vague shape of a fetus with a brain and umbilical cord in the pattern.</i>
</center>


Giygas is the penultimate villain and final boss of Earthbound and it's honestly hard to describe what it even is in lore. It's an abstract, non-corporeal personification of evilness in general. You get to the final fight by first traveling into the future where all life on earth and even the athmosphere is completely destroyed, you enter a womb-like structure and fighting against it it's the first and only Earthbound fight that is not just a static sprite in front of a shader background (except for pokey at during the first phase). Rather, the shader background *is* the enemy producing an effect of overwhelming size and etherealness. Shigesato Itoi, Earthbounds designer, credited the experience of walking into the wrong cinema and seeing a very violent scene as a young child as inspiration for Giygas presentation and I think it is one of the most memorable villains in all of gaming, not because of writing or mechanics but because of it's position and the tone of the encounter relative to the game it resides in. Up until this fight Earthbound was really light hearted, there were some midly disturbing concepts like being in a cult and zombies but at five-seconds-before-midnight hour of the plot Earthbound goes from Pokémon Villains to full Lovecraft out of nowhere. I personally think that this and only this is why it Giygas has such an impact. The things that make Earthbound special and memorable aren't inherent to their properties, rather it's those properties in relation the established norms of traditiona jRPGs, of kids games, of Earthbounds own plots tone. Earthbound is a traditional jRPG in every way except in affect, it tries very very hard to be unlike them and for most people it succeeds. Rather than adding to the gameplay in a mechanically meaningful way it adds spice, so much spice in fact that instead of seeming try-hard it blew past that and ascended to cult status and became one of the most influential games of all time. 
I may have been coming of as negative so far but I do want to explicitely state that Earthbounds deserves this. Earthbound is an amazing game, amazing despite it's gameplay and that gameplay barely matters if all other parts are this unique

... that is until it wasn't unique anymore like 10 years later.

Let's quickly take inventory of some of Earthbounds properties though:
+ quirky and light-hearted world
+ surreal, character-introduction-driven plot (each chapter corresponds to one party member) 
+ very literal plot (there are no big themes or metaphors tackled)
+ shallow jRPG battle system with great presentation
+ mechanics are added for flavor, not for depth
+ plot suddenly shifts to very dark subject matter 

### 3 RPG Maker

So you really liked Earthbound and you want to make your own Earthbound, what do you do? Well you could get a degree in CS and learn to program and spend 3 years in your bedroom creating a game from scratch OR you could just take Earthbound and... make it yours by modifying the actual game for the SNES with hacking tools. This is called romhacking and I only want to mention Earthbound romhacking scene because of one very important actor that will have their start here but even in 2000 people wanted to make their own Earthbound and while they didn't technically need to be able to code it was still kinda hard for the non tech-literate. That is until in late 2000 [RPG Maker](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/) was created. Intended as 45% Engine, 45% development tool, 10% publishing platform RPG Maker boiled traditional jRPGs down  to their purest form. It was literally designed to be a tropy jRPG, turn-based combat, high-fantasy setting, tile-based movement, 2d-sprites, the works. It was also designed to be incredibly easy to use and it was, much like what Flash was for animators, with RPG Maker every person with a small amount of determination and even smaller amount of money can create their own game. However the games were inherently limited. Modifying the RPG Maker engine is hard, not only do the Terms of Service not really like that but it just doesn't give tools and absolute freedom some games need: Games had to run in a tiny window at native resolution, it was terribly optimized, displaying fonts broke constantly, features were slowly getting rolled out with bad backwards-compatibility, it wasn't a very good game engine back then (I heard it's pretty decent nowadays though) but what it was very good at was giving players who were really into that Earthbound game a tool to make their own. And they did. 

### 3.1 Yume Nikki

<center>

<br><b>Figure 3.1</b>: <i><a href="https://yumenikki.fandom.com/wiki/KyuuKyuu-kun" target="_blank">KyūKyū-kun</a>, a non-interactable NPC in Yume Nikki who rubs a staricase, emitting a scrubbing noise similar to plastic gloves on glass (source: giantbomb)</i>
</center>


Yume Nikki was released by the highly emblematic "Kikiyama", the games name in japanese translates to "dream diaries" and fitting of it's title it's incomprehensible yet incredibly emotionally affecting. It was made with a very old version of RPG Maker and I can't help but think that that is why Yume Nikki chose to completely forgo one of the defining features of jRPGs: turn-based combat. Yume Nikki is a jRPG excep it's all overworld. There's basically no puzzles and in the game you just kinda walk around, looking at things. Today some would call Yume Nikki a walking simulator, you explore a set of vast worlds, 
visually distinct from each other but very same-y within themself. Limited Interaction with the environment happens through 
"costumes", collectable items you can pick up and equip that may just change the sprite of the player character or may
interact with other objects like for example brandishing a knife to attack certain enemies. [Others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPlibu9VeOI) have done great
work describing this game and what is appealing about it far better than I ever could so instead I would like to focus on a few very specific things: In Yume Nikki you play as a girl that is confirmed to be a Hikikomori, a young adult that basically refuses to leave their room instead exclusively engaging in solitude and media. In game you start in this room and to access the different worlds you use the titular dream journal. This way of accessing the actual games worlds frames them as inherently surreal, but most importently explicitely as a product of the main characters psychology. For example in one world you can see a car crash victims body lying on the street bleeding out and while there is neither dialogue nor much in the way of interaction the framing of the game cements this imagery as a 
 representation of trauma of the main character and as Madotsuki (that's her name) is basically a blank slate and the project feels so much like outsider-art it is reasonable to project that trauma onto the dev themself. The car crash scene moves the goalpost in a way where now every single element of the mostly non-sensical world can possibly be interpreted and projected like this. I think that along with the trance-like experience of walking around surreal beautiful but highly repeptitious worlds with athmospheric music and no goal or purpose other than to see more is why this game is so special. There is a giant, very passionate fan-community around this game, both in japan and the US. I genuinely cannot overemphasize how huge this game is in certain circles, every character in the game be it important even if they literally have no purpose other than being a visual element. Most notably is the almost main-stream famous <a href="https://yumenikki.fandom.com/wiki/Uboa" target="_blank">Uboa</a> who is so obscure I won't even go into him more right here. No matter how purposeless the visual elements are, all become functionally equivalent in the audiences mind because all of them become an expressionist element in the exploration of Madotsukis mind.
Yume Nikki is a very strange game, it has no relation to traditional jRPGs other than also being seen through a 2d sprite-based 
tiled top down perspective and being made in RPG Maker but by being so strange yet endearing it has become an 
influence on a whole generation of indie-devs. Maybe it is because of the RPG Maker community but over the years most games inspired by earthbound were made by people who were also in turn inspired by Yume Nikki and I think seeing this game as the Castlevania of Metroidvanias, the Bloodborne of Souls-like, one of the ur-members of the Earthbound-like lineage sheds light on not only it's influence but on what made the game interesting even in 2003.

</center>

Similar to the chapter on Earthbound I would like to take inventory of Yume Nikkis properties:
+ surreal world that is a metaphorical exploration of the main character damaged psyche
+ made in RPG Maker by a single person overseas
+ no mechanical or strategic challenge

As we continue with these inventories, you'll hopefully see where I am going with this. First let's look at another early-gen RPG-Maker game made by an anonymous developer in a non-english speaking country though:

### 3.2 OFF

OFF is a bad game. OFF is also an important game. I don't actually want to judge the games quality but unlike Yume Nikki I don't consider it a pillar of the genre, rather I would like to use OFF as a case-study to stand in for many, many other RPG Maker games that are in the same vein.
I'd like to show you two screenshots from OFF, hopefully without context. Try to only look at the first, read the paragraph below it and then look at the second 

<center>
<img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/e57f6bcf729b4a758a65efd7bc12ee5f/tumblr_pwnrmjS1b41uuwlpwo1_640.png">
<br><b>Figure 3.2</b>: <i>OFFs overworld</i>
</center>

I think most would recognize that this is a RPG-Maker game. It's very basic, just solid colors and an overworld sprite so bland you could be forgiven if you think it's as a placeholder. Movement feels terrible, the puzzles are terrible, the dialogue is horrendously translated and it runs in a tiny 400px x 300px window that cannot be maximized. Now let me show you the second glimpse of the game:

<small>(thank you to [Kairin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3AALruIRZN-GMcxxZlzO7Q) for providing this footage)</small>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aICiWtsv4mI?start=1535" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Now, I don't actually know how long you've kept watching but hopefully you experience at least some of the spark this game emits. It's still rough, the sprites for the party are literally just circles and a pixelated .png, it's still a vanilla RPG Maker with terrible balancing and very little in terms of strategy but despite all of this it looks and sounds completely unique. The hand-drawn if not doodled look was achieved by <a href="https://off.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Concept_Art" target="_blank">literally drawing the sprites on paper</a> and scanning the pages, down-res them and put them in the game. Now this might not be totally true but what I'm trying to make not of here is that the games graphic do give you that feeling. It's not immersizve whatsoever, instead the process of creating the game was made obvious and instantly recognizable. If you actually play the game not just the battles do this, cutscenes will have scanned in prints from old libraries, the dialogue reads like someone with a decent knowledge of french and suboptimal knowledge of english spend 2 evenings translating all the files in the RPG Maker repo but none of that matters for the experience of the game. It's process over product, form over meaning and much like Yume Nikki it confronts the audience directly with who made it. In OFFs case one might say a bored french musician who just needed an outlet and in Yumei Nikkis case opinions vary from a traumatized japanese hikikomori who wanted to translate his dispair into a game to just a talented artists with a strong sense of how to do expressionism well but what is true in any of these cases is that the game becomes an examination of the person who created it. RPG Maker games are rarely made by studios, they're rarely made by experience devs, most often they are made by a single person with no budget and no coding experience who wanted to make something important enough for them to pour hundreds of hours of effort into creating it.

Let's do our inventory for OFF:
+ surreal world that is simply a framework to show of the developers irl illustrations and music
+ made in RPG Maker by a single person over-seas
+ no mechanical or strategic challenge

I've cheekily copy pasted some of those points in order to strengthen my thesis but let's keep going anyway:

### 4. Super Mario RPG, Super Star Saga and Paper Mario 64

Taking a break from the no-budget indie games I'd like to circle back to a first-party game that had all the funding in 
the world and (unlike earthbound) the matching success. In 1996 Nintendo joined forces with the at that point incredibly critically acclaimed square who was just fresh of Final Fantasy 3, one of the best jRPG of all time, to use the lovable plumber known for jumping when you press A in a...turn-based battle system? I think the devs were aware of this discrepancy and proceeded to solve the issue with a fresh and ingenious idea they went on to carry an entire franchise worth of sequels. 

<center>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/L9b0H7l.gif">
<br><b>Figure 4.0</b>: <i>A basic battle against a flying koopa enemy in Super Mario RPG (SNES). Note that in order to execute the shell kick at maximum damage the player has to time the A press with the animation of the shell hitting the floor in front of mario.</i>
</center>

They created on of the in my opinion best mechanics ever implemented for a turn-based game: action commands. Instead of just menu'ing and hitting A to select a movve you have to now also an additional A-press in what may be described as a quick time event (QTE) nowadays. In Super Mario RPG (SNES) said QTE was pretty much diagetic, there's no "hit A now" prompt, instead you have to time the press based on the animation happening on screen. This system is fuzzy, much like a rhythm game the closer to perfect you do the input the more damage will the move will do. As the game went on, action commands got more and more complex, from simply pressing A once when attacking or defending to pressing A <a href="https://papermariorta.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Mario_RPG:_Legend_of_the_Seven_Stars#100_Jumps" target="_blank">frame-perfectly 100 times</a> in order to execute the highest damaging combo which is used by speed runners to obliterate every boss in no time. Later games in the series would incorporate more than just one button and with better technology better animations were possible to accompany them.
I would like to quickly distinguish between traditional QTEs (as seen in Resident Evil 4 for example) and action commands. In my opinion it comes down to this: a) does failing the button press result in a fail-state and b) does perfectly executing the command result in an additional effect on top of the default outcome. In RE4 if you don't press the button fast enough you get eaten by the big fish and have to reload a save, hitting it perfectly is the default state, you don't get any additional effect it's simply a challenge to overcome so the game can continue. In action games like Bayonetta, failing the QTE will result in a fail-state however doing the QTE well (for example hitting a button really fast) will not only let you continue with the game but get a bonus reward of extra currency or points. In the Mario RPG series and many Earthbound-likes in general, failing the QTE does not result in a fail-state, for some moves it does not result in any punishment compared to the default at all. You can play mother 3 without ever hitting a single QTE, it'll play just like Earthbound but if you do hit that games rhythm based action command your attack will deal extra damage. That's the difference, failing a traditional QTE results in a fail-state, winning continues the game. Failing an action command doesn't do anything, completing it result in a bonus. This is a spectrum with something like bayonetta being square in the middle. Either way the point of action commands was to replicate another more mainstream genres gameplay and even in 1996 it succeeds at that, replicating what would ordinarily be timing a jump in a mario platformer by instead tying the input and animation to an attack in the context of a jRPG combat system.

I will not attribute this quote to anyone directly but a general sentiment about why jRPGs have become niche is that players expect "actual gameplay instead of just pressing A on a menu". While the validity of this claim is questionable I think what is meant by this is that traditional jRPGs do not offer mechanical challenge while most other genres of games, especially the big profitable ones, are by their very core about mechanical challenge first and foremost. Games about strategy and simulation tend to be more niche and I think herein lies the problem, it's not that many traditional jRPGs lack mechanical challenge, it's that that mechanical challenge is rarely (especially in Earthbound-likes) substituted with strategic gameplay. Few would call a Paradox a game about clicking on menus because it offers strategic and intellectual depth instead. Earthbound-likes, at least those we've looked at here, do not offer strategic depth. That doesn't make them bad games it just means it leaves their mass-market appeal below those of more traditional games - until Mario RPG and later (and probably most succesfully) Paper Mario 64 presented the same Earthbound-like package except this time fights stimulate your hands as well. It worked, big-time, I know many people who would never finish an RPG Maker game or even call themself interested in RPGs but who love Paper Mario to death and unlike Earthbound Nintendo to this day keeps some of their first party studios busy developing Mario RPG games for their consoles. 

I don't think that "final fantasy but with mario and QTEs" fully represents the true appeal of the Mario RPG series. Unlike most other Nintendo properties the writers of the games and especially Super Mario RPG and Super Star Saga were given complete freedom. Both games do share enemies and elements with other Mario Games but they might as well take place in a paralell dimension, completely new art styles and fully fledged characters in place of the personality-less Mario characters like Bowser or Mario himself flesh out a world that was very much it's own thing - with a light Mario coat of paint for marketability.

What I'm trying to say is that the Mario RPG series are unlike other Mario games, instead they are very much alike Earthbound-likes: A surreal, very literal plot, quirky setting and visual design, meta-commentary on the genre of jRPGs, the works. Mario & Luigi: Super Star Saga even has the sudden unexpectedly disturbing final boss fight (c.f. Figure 4.3 below). I can't say if the devs were directly inspired by Earthbound but what I can state with confidence, however, is that future Earthbound-likes were very much inspired by the Mario RPG series. Suddenly, non-strategic jRPG combat felt less tolerable, you don't have to make it complicated but you do have to make it unique and/or "more". Not all games did the same system as Mario RPG, they may insert a <a href="https://wikibound.info/wiki/Sound_Battle" target="_blank">rhythm mini game</a>, a <a href="https://jcw87.github.io/c2-sans-fight/" target="_blank">shmup or platformer</a>, a <a href="https://lisa-rpg.fandom.com/wiki/Armstrong_Style" target="_blank">fighting game</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-09-22-undertale-walkthrough-pacifist-guide-tips-4873?page=5#:~:text=There's%2020G%20hidden%20in%20the,Style%20outfit%20examine%20his%20hat." target="_blank">dating sim</a>, anything really. What genre to pull gameplay from is truly arbitrary and I think the wide variety of what devs would translate Mario RPGs action commands into shows how Earthbound-like combat isn't able to stand on it's own in a post-Mario RPG world.. I want to explicitely state again: jRPG combat doesn't have to be hard or complex, games don't have to have good combat to be good games at all. I want to instead just neutrally remark that adding mechanically interesting gameplay on top of the quintessential and thus generic jRPG gameplay without modifying that base is a very common trait for Earthbound-likes. That is what Mario RPG went on to bring to the lineage, action commands are genius and it turns out they do especially well at making vanilla jRPG combat more exciting and appealing.

### LISA: The Painful

(content warning: descriptions of gore, sexual violence and domestic abuse)

LISA is another RPG Maker game whoever I consider it fairly distinct and I think most people who aren't intimiately 
familiar with the engine or read up on it will not immediately notice that LISA is made in it. For one the perspective
is shifted from a top down view to 2d side-view similar to the original mario games. Another thing that makes LISA 
stand out from the crowd of RPG Maker games is it's "combo system". Instead of simply selecting an attack or consumable
from a static list the player instead has to input a combination of buttons, for example WAA could be a punch and WSS 
could be a kick and so on. Not every permutation of {W, A, S, D} has a corresponding attack but that is precisely the point
in my opinion. You could argue that this is pointed, in the end it is functionally equivalent to just selecting an attack
but I would disagree with this. For one the most obvious advantage of this system is simulating mechanical challenge. 
It is not actually hard to input certain moves and there's even a list of all combinations however pressing 4 keys 
each time you attack and having it be accompanied by a flashy combination simulates what the Mario RPG series did so
execellently: there is now a tactile component to the RPG Maker combat and I think while intellectually it doesn't 
seem that valuable from a player experience point of view it improves the game. 
Now you may by no have noticed a trend in my writing, I don't really want to talk about a game in detail or review, I 
don't really want to talk about a game in detail or review it rather I want to first find out why a game is an 
earthbound-like and then identify what part of that game became a gene passed down in future generations of earthbound-likes.
For LISA, this is not the combo system. It's not the 2D view and the light platforming that comes with that rather it is
it's adult themes. It's still quirky but lisa has explicit gore, violence, rape, body horror, etc.. None of this will 
be actually disturbing to most people because it is after all a low-res RPG Maker game that looks kinda same-y but the 
game does a good job of framing these disturbing things in a way were they actually land. For example in one scene the
protagonist is trying to find out where another character is being held and to do this he captures and then tortures one
of the enemy combatants. Not only is it an explicit cutscene of just that happening but the player actively takes part 
in it having to hit a QTE for each punch the main character (henceforth "MC") inflicts on the captive. 
In a similar scene the MC has a flashback to his childhood of living in a low-income house with a father that is explicitely 
abusive both emotionally and phsyically (and most likely sexually as can be inferred from subtext in LISAs predecessor).
This is shown, you actually see your father belittle you and throw a bottle at you and you manually walk the MC to a 
playground to get beaten up and bullied. I am not comfortable of inferring things of a still-livign artists personal life
but the framing implies this as very personal and similar to Yume Nikki this intimitacy acts as an amplifier for how 
serious the player takes the violence. LISA can be funny, gross and is almost always quirky but what makes it special
enough to change the course of the genre of earthbound-likes is how it dealt with explicit, highly disturbing subject 
matter in a way that in no way minimized them and made it feel personally by having the player play through the revelant
sequences.

TODO: pic of brad getting bottle thrown at him

Also I shouldn't just leave it merely implied, LISA is more graphic than most people would expect, it doesn't go as far
as to literally show sexual violence but characters get their arms cut off, their face melted, shoot themself in the head
and slowly bleed out on the floor while their intestent are hanging out of their punctured belly. I don't consider 
violence for violences sake a feature that improves a work of art but by staying respesctful when it is warranted (like
with sexual abuse or domestic violence against children) and balancing out the gore and blood with enough absurdity and
jokes LISA kind of ripped off the band-aid. Since LISA (there are almost certainly games before it that did this of course), nothing it taboo anymore. Earthbound-likes are free to show whatever they want and making a game that is explicitely adult-only is not only commercially viable but is respected by the audience.

### And so came many others

With dev-tools improving and earthbound-likes finding indie success RPG Maker games went from being an underground thing
for people who "aren't able to make real games" to a valid genre. As such many many other followed, some of them were 
simple made-by-one-teenager games that don't really have anything good to offer but still had love and effort poured into
them. RPG Maker games stopped being jRPGs, titles like "To the moon" used the tool to tell a straight forward drama that 
is more akin to a traditional walking simulator and had writing that is legendary for making most people cry and as such
will fit right in with "Gone Home" and similar titles. Professional artists came out of the woodworks and used RPG Maker
not only as an outlet but as a job, creating games like "Omori" landing 6-figure kickstarter campaigns and having
multi-person teams working on not only the game but ports and merchandise and nowadays in 2021 RPG Maker seized to be
a trope, a type of game and is now an engine for 2D games, just like Unity or Unreal. I'm glossing over many excellent 
titles for the sake of brevity but let me just list off a bunch of them as I do actually want to make a point:

i) Oneshot: a "roguelike" game where you can only die once, the game locks up afterwards so you really do only have "one shot"
ii) Yume 2kki, an official sequel sanctioned by the original dev
iii) Jimmy and the Pulsating Mess, a true earthbound-like in that it is very much like earthbound, luckily Earthbound is good
enough for that to be a hook, not a negative
iv) Mother4 (now renamed to TODO): an actual sequel the the warmly regarded but cast-into-obscurity-by-nintendo to the 
next game in the Mother series: mother 3. Mother4 was a multi-person project that was put on hold when the chance of
getting a seize-and-desist by nintendo seem likely enough to warrant filing off the serial numbers in order to transform
the project into something commercially viable
v) Ib, a spritiual sequel to yume nikki that took the afterthough that was melee combat and made it a core-feature of the 
gameplay, completely substituting turn-based-combat instead
vi) "The Witches House", "Mad Father", "Angels of Death" three game whos devs are unrelated but that all brought true horror
into the RPG Maker format. These games are much closer to resident evil than to final fantasy and much like LISA do not 
hold back in the violence and disturbing subject matter 

All games I've listed in this chapter (and all previous chapters) are great games. I may not love some of them but 
I consider them important and worth the time and money that was spend to create them. They are the cream that rose to the 
top out of an arguably endless see of half-abandoned or naively implement RPG Maker games/clones and I cannot stress 
enough how many there were. Seeing that you can actually sell these games for real money many devs tried to promote their
hobby-project they just made to learn how to do pixel art into a job. I will never condemn artistic ambition but I think
I echo many more mainstream-gamers thoughts when I state that earthbound-like went from a type of game to a vast community,
if you wanted to do you can have your entire life revolve around them, all your friends are into them, you live on the RPG 
Maker forums, you watch youtubers (TODO: link NitroRad, Jordan Under) that cover them, you found your boyfriend on an 
RPG Maker discord server and you haven't touched your oil colors and brushes because you only do pixel art now. I'm being
facetious but there really was a community here, it was still a niche hobby but it was very much not obscure anymore. However...

### Then came Undertale 
The big one, one of the most influential games of all time in my opinion and *the* supposed rags-to-riches story of a 
guy in his bedroom playing around with first RPG Maker and then Game Maker that made a game that blew up and sold over 
a million copies. Now first I would like to explicitely state that the time-line I am implying in this essay is not 
perfectly chronological. It wasn't that LISA came first and only then came all the adult RPG Maker games and similarly 
it was just Undertale that started the boom but I still think it's valuable to regard Undertale as a giant TODO-shift. 

Undertale was made by two people, a programmer/designer/writer and an graphical artists and at first it doesn't seem that
special. Undertales replaced the Mario RPG QTEs in battle with little SHMUP sections. Instead of just attacking you 
could now befriend enemies too, maybe a mob doesn't need to be slain but rather just needs a hug. Undertales world was
rich and filled with creativity and memorable characters. However undertale was still a small game, it had very few 
bells and whistles and doesn't really feel like a product but as something someone really wanted to make'. And it just 
happened to be made in a way that made lightning strike. Every undertale character has their own community, Sans is 
in super smash brothers, the fact that tumblr and deviant art almost spilled over with the amount of undertale fanart is
so well-known that people will use phrases like "night in the woods is the new undertale". "golf story is the new undertale".
I will admit I'm creating a strawman by reproducing these quotes without attribution but for the sake of argument I would 
like to examine what that means. "X is the new undertale" does not only imply that x is most likely an earthbound-like 
adjacent game, a personal story made by a small indie team with quirky characters and emotional, relatable
themes, amazing music and graphics but also that it is derivative. By the point undertale broke into the mainstream 
the earthbound-like became formulaic. People will often point to undertale as an intentional subversion of many tropes,
killing monsters actually has a detremental effect in canon, you get to talk instead of attack, the game is very meta 
with characters leaving files on your computer or intentionally crashing the game however if you were exposed to earthbound-likes
that came before it you will recognize every one of these tropes, most likely from multiple games. Like all art, Undertale 
is iterative, it build on what came before it and I think the reason people found it so fresh is that undertale was new
to the mainstream. Most people don't play RPG Maker games, most people will call Yume Nikki a terrible pointless game 
but Undertale was so accesible, so relatable, so much of lightning in a bottle that it ascended all of these properties 
and like all the great earthbound-likes before it it brought something new to the genepool. 

I want to break character for a moment here and talk about myself. I don't like undertale. I would never call it bad 
or fault someone for having it be their favorite thing but I think because undertale was such a huge success critical 
mass was hit and suddenly most of the earthbound-like community wasn't there because of the rich history but because of 
undertale. This isn't a bad thing, it's always good to grow but what this resulted in were games not iterating upon 
all the earthbound-likes that came before but on undertale specifically. A game had to be quirky, have a consistent world,
look nice, have great music, be technically a jRPG but have a "gimmick" on top of the regular combat, be character-driven
not as a character study but as a journey that interacted with characters, have a very literal plot by which I mean all
 events are perceived as happening diagetically, they had to deal with emotional mental-ill related themes like 
 anxiety, social awkwardness, feeling lonely or without purpose and what I'm trying to say is that since undertale, 
 this is the definition of an earthbound-like. Undertale was the culmination of what came before it, it had every gene 
 mentioned in this piece at conception but because Undertale attracted so many players that were not able to recognize 
 this fact it effectively erased much of the genres history and replaced it with "like undertale". It's why my friend 
 who I mentioned in the first paragraphed recognised omori as "another one of those". I'm not saying Omori is that 
 derivative but I mention it to illustrate who from someone looking in, someone who never played a good RPG Maker game,
 someone who thinks turn-based combat is boring and archaic, for a person like this, Omori is "another one". In the 
 same paragraph I also said that the definition of earthbound-likes are a see-it-and-you-know-it type. I still stand 
 by this however since Undertale, I think we'll be able to get a proper definition. Something clearly define, something
 very close to the list of properties I just listed of. Let's go through them again, one-by-one:
 
 ### An actual Definition
 
 (content warning: math)
 
 A game can be considered an earthbound-like if it has enough of the following features:
 
 a) It is build on a framework that is considered like those of jRPGs, meaning...
    a1) It has 2d, sprite-based, low resolution pixelart style graphics
    a2) it is build around two distinct states ("scene"), in the "overworld" the player moves through a diagetic world, 
    usually on 2 axis, solves light puzzles and interacts with other characters by for example talking to them or triggering 
    the second states "battle" in which the player engages in an abstract representation of what diagetically is violence, 
    social interaction or any another form of the one or more player entities interacting with one or more non-player entities
    a3) Movement on the overworld is fairly basic
    a4) there is very little mechanical challenge and mechanical depth in any gameplay system
    a5) puzzles may be present however are rarely the focus of the game
    a6) Can have their inspirations followed back to either DnD, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest or...
b) ...is directly or indirectly iterating on Mother 2: Earthbound, meaning
    b1) Is has world that is not featured in traditional fantasy- or horror- games
    b2) Is very character driven were chapters may revolve around a certain character instead of an activity
    b3) have a very literal plot, meaning all actions during the plot are diagetic and non-metaphorical
    b4) have a quirky world that has both comedic and dramatic writing
    b5) intends to represent an intensiely intimate and personal experience 
    b6) has moments of overt horror and dark or surprisingly disturbing subject matter
c) focus a lot of it's presentation on static illustration and music, rarely animation or technical fidelity
d) is aimed at a niche non-mainstream audience of younger (born after ~1989) players of any gender
e) are made by a small team of either indie developers or if first party by a director that has not participated in many 
mainstream projects

Okay. There we have, it an actual definition. While reading you most likely already picked one of the properties and 
thought of a game I mentioned here that does not fullfill it so I'd like to again restate how malleable this and any genre
really is. Games can be multiple genres at once, even if they're more obscure. You can be a souls-like metroidvania, a 
platformer racer, etc.. Secondly, who am I to just state a definition as this and tell others that that's what it means 
and other should abide by that. I'm not, I mean I objectively am but what I do not have is the authority or intend to 
force my opinion on others. What I tried to achieve in this piece instead is give a very surface-level history of a lineage 
of games that I think most people would consider related, how (but not in what order) the iterated on each other and how
it all culimated in many great, truly amazing games. Like any genre, earthbound-likes have tropes. Often these will be 
perceived as for example "another game about depression/social anxiety" or "nother jrpg with boring combat" and sometimes
a game will subvert these tropes and sometimes they will reproduce them exactly but offer something else in a way where 
it eclipses the staleness and instead becomes something special. Hopefully with this you will now be able to not only 
recognize an earthbound-like but be aware of the depth and history it carries with it and you hopefully will be motivated
by this new game to go back and explore older games like it. Going mainstream isn't it a bad thing, it's just a thing and 
if that means more people get to play these games and more importantly, more developers get to make more I consider that 
very important. 

Thank you for reading,
C.

### Hidden Epilogue: Is rat_game an earthbound-like?

(content warning:  descpritions of sexual violence towards minors, genocide)

I'd like to say a quick thank you for reading, I know it was a lot. Hopefully I remember to hid this part somewhat as 
I don't think it will be relevant to a lot of people so feel free to skip this. If you decided not to then let me clear 
my concious by saying that I lied to you. In the very first paragraph my friend on seeing a screenshot of Omori said 
"Looks neat but man I just get the vibe it's a generic JRPG in a cool package". I then stated that I intuitively ask 
myself two question. This is not true, I asked myself one additional question: "Is that what rat_game is too?". What my 
friend said caused a lot of anxiety, for me rat_game is something very special, something so intensely personal that 
I don't want any of my irl friends to play it so they don't find out things about me I wouldn't share myself and being 
told that that was just another one what basically means undertale clone was something I had to process. Now the mathematician 
in me would try to rationally prove or disprove this by going through my above definition and checking if all of the 
properties apply to rat_game but I think that's missing the forest for the trees. I shouldn't focus on "is rat_game an earthbound-like" but rather on "is rat_game another generic earthbound-like". I tried my best to sound neutral and 
not to condescending in this essay but I have played a lot of earthbound-likes both for fun and for research and on top
of noticing the properties I outlined in my definition I noticed another thing: Most of them are about mildly disturbing 
things like curable mental-illnesses, midly disturbing violence like car accidents or the death of a family member and 
most of them don't really try to be head-y high art: Earthbound doesn't really have themes, it's not a commentary on 
anything, really, it just tried to be a quirky fun game and during that it made fun of some of the genre tropes (like
waiting behind the waterfall for 30mins irl) while replicating others by the letter (like it being possible to just 
grind your way through everything). This doesn't make Earthbound worse of course, not everything has to try to be 
on that level but... I do. Most of the plot of rat_game is a metaphor for events of my life. rat_game isn't just about
social anxiety or depression, it's about incurable diseases like schizophrenia or severe PTSD, how things like that 
make your entire life impossible as every single thing in your reality is colored by it and also how despite 
that people persevere and try to find happiness. rat_game has violence but, idk, at first I wanted to go all out. There's 
a brothel in rat_game and during the chapter where you explore it you go further and furhter down into the ground and 
I want each floor to get lower "morally", too. LIke the first floor is vanilla prostitues, then a few floors down it's 
bdsm, a few floors down it's underage teens and snuff films and what comes even below that I will leave to your 
imagination. While this is included in the plot know that I would never explicitely show it without having a very, very
good reason for it. Look towards a film like "irreversiblé" to see how much of a point art has to have to justify having
a realistic rape scene and I think this is true for all subject matter this extreme. The plot of rat_game involves 
genocide, during the calamity 60% of all humans were executed. Hell, the second to last chapter takes places exclusively 
in a giant hole basically where all the bodies were dumped. I don't think most earthbound-likes would go that far but
that's not really important, I'm not just bringing these up to go "oh see how much more mature I am" I'm bringing this
up because at no point did I see something in another earthbound-like and go "I want that too in my game". Form the
beginning I know what I wanted, I wanted to make a game about, me basically. Not literally about me but about my life
experience and by chance most of the things that happened in my life are way way worse than what many people would even
tolerate in fiction. And thus, most of the things that happen in rat_game are way way worse than what many people woud
have tolerated in... earthbound. Or undertale. Or a mainstream RPG Maker game. What I'm trying to say is that rat_game
is indeed an earthbound-like, there's is no question. However it isn't an earhtbound because I wanted to make an 
earthbound-like, I wanted to make rat_game and at least consciously I tried so in a vaccuum away from genre tropes 
or marketability and while I can't guruantee it I at least have hope that that will make it "not just another jRPG about depression" but I guess we all have to find out once it's done.

that people persevere and try to find happiness. rat_game has violence but, idk, at first I wanted to go all out. There's 
a brothel in rat_game and during the chapter where you explore it you go further and furhter down into the ground and 
I want each floor to get lower "morally", too. LIke the first floor is vanilla prostitues, then a few floors down it's 
bdsm, a few floors down it's underage teens and snuff films and what comes even below that I will leave to your 
imagination. While this is included in the plot know that I would never explicitely show it without having a very, very
good reason for it. Look towards a film like "irreversiblé" to see how much of a point art has to have to justify having
a realistic rape scene and I think this is true for all subject matter this extreme. The plot of rat_game involves 
genocide, during the calamity 60% of all humans were executed. Hell, the second to last chapter takes places exclusively 
in a giant hole basically where all the bodies were dumped. I don't think most earthbound-likes would go that far but
that's not really important, I'm not just bringing these up to go "oh see how much more mature I am" I'm bringing this
up because at no point did I see something in another earthbound-like and go "I want that too in my game". Form the
beginning I know what I wanted, I wanted to make a game about, me basically. Not literally about me but about my life
experience and by chance most of the things that happened in my life are way way worse than what many people would even
tolerate in fiction. And thus, most of the things that happen in rat_game are way way worse than what many people woud
have tolerated in... earthbound. Or undertale. Or a mainstream RPG Maker game. What I'm trying to say is that rat_game
is indeed an earthbound-like, there's is no question. However it isn't an earhtbound because I wanted to make an 
earthbound-like, I wanted to make rat_game and at least consciously I tried so in a vaccuum away from genre tropes 
or marketability and while I can't guruantee it I at least have hope that that will make it "not just another jRPG about depression" but I guess we all have to find out once it's done.
