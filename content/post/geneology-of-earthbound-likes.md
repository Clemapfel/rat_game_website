## 1. Motivation

I want to start this piece on a personal note, I was casually talking to a friend and I opened the conversation by showing them the following screenshot of a "omori" (which is by all accounts a very good game) completely out of context:

https://robots.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Combat.jpg

I just thought it looks nice, right? Their reaction was a lot stronger than I anticipated: "Looks neat but man I just get the vibe it's a generic [western] jRPG in a cool package".
I poked further and they went on to elaborate that they feel it's just another one of "those" games, midly disturbing subject matter, quirky world, supposedly shallow jRPG combat and an amazing visual presentation. The conversation went on but I kept thinking about what they said. It implies that omori is part of a lineage, that a out-of-context screenshot of it's battle system is enough evidence to not only know it is but to also judge it as so alike every other game in that lineage that it becomes generic. 

In this piece I will not argue for or against omori or talk about it much at all, I won't even disclose if I agree with my friend, rather I would like to examine how we got here and what my friend was comparing omori to.

## 1.1 Some Examples

I will call the genre omori is in "earthbound-like". I think most will be familiar with the term "souls-like" which may have more clearly formulated properties [1] but for the sake of argument I will simply give a one-line: "A souls-like game is a game that was inspired by Dark Souls". An earthbounhd-like, then, is obvioulsy a game inspired by Mother 2: Earthbound but I think it goes deeper than that. As I aim to illustrate in this piece Earthbound-like follow a very clear timeline of influences, earthbound way first, then other games were inspired by it and similarly to bloodborne for souls-like or castleania for metroidvanias became part of the genres pool of mechanics and inspirations. Hopefully as I illustrate my point with more and more games you yourself will form a list of properties for earthbound-likes so specific that they warrant to become a sub-genre themself. 

Here is a non-exhaustive non-ordered list of games[2] I consider Earthbound-likes:

+ The Mother Series (Mother 1, Mother 2: Earthbound, Mother 3)
+ Mario RPG (SNES), Paper Mario 64, Paper Mario: TTYD, Mario & Luigi: Super Star Saga, M&L: Bowsers Inside Story, M&L: Partners in Time
+ Most if not all of the commercially released RPG-Maker games, including but not limited to:
    + Yumei-Nikki, Yumei 2kki, LISA, To the Moon, OFF, One Shot, Escaped Chasms, .flow, Mother 4 (the fangame), IB, Dreaming Mary, The Witch's House, Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass, Dujanah, Hylics, Suits: A Business RPG
+ Undertale, Deltarune

I think most people can already form a somewhat clear picture of what I mean but let's start this for real and what better place to star than the game that started it all.

[1] Properties Include: Punishing and methodic gameplay, a rechargable health item that has a limited amount of uses per death (estus flask), strategically played save points (bonfires), loosing a currency upon death but being given the chance to visit the place of demise and collect most or all of the lost currency, etc.

## 2. History & Lineage

### 2.1 Earthbound
~~Earthbound is the Dark-Souls of..., no, I'm sorry, what I meant to say is that~~ When Earthbound released it tanked in sales, became relatively obscure almost immediately and didn't even get a PAL import because Nintendo didn't want to bother. To this day Mother 3 which is objectively a great game and whos Protagonist is in Smash Bros still has not received official localization, that's how traumatic Earthbounds lack of success was. Many blamed this on the stink-based (https://earthboundcentral.com/2010/03/earthbound-in-nintendo-power-73/) advertising but I personally believe it was mostly due to the fact that the game was bundled with a strategy guide, raising the price above what similar games would've costed off the shelf and most children in 1994 weren't willing to take a risk and spend their entires years gaming-budget on a game actively marketed as super weird, out there and unlike any other. That last point is not technically true however, Earthbound was much alike it's prequel: Mother 1 for the NES (later released as Earthbound Origins on the nintendo Eshop). I don't want to dwell to deep on earthbounds history and Mother 1 as this piece will already be long enough but I do want to note here that earthbound wasn't iconic when it came out, it took some time to become iconic. I personally played the game for the first time in 2014 on an emulator and while I think that I was relatively late to the party most people who would eventually get *really* into earthbound played around the start of the 2000s. 

https://earthboundcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Secret_Saturn_Valley_in_Mother_by_GreggJanus.png

So what made earthbound special? Fo one it was a good game but I think what made it stand out is how unlike traditional jRPG [3] it really was. It was set in suburban america, you had to actually put your money into an ATM, enemies were rabid dogs, angry ducks, homeless people, 3 psychic-ly connected moles, full-sized dinosaurs, a guy that lives inside a dungeon and the dungeon also walks around, you get the idea. It's story was almost nonsensical, an episodic fever dream of walking around a surreal world erasing pencil-shaped roadblocks made out of metal and waiting behind a waterfall for 1h to fight a literal pile of vomit. Earthbound was odd, quirky and - unlike it's advertising - incredibly charming. Pairing that with great graphics even by todays standards and one of the best soundtracks in all of gaming and you get a cult classic. All of these things only made up half of Earthbounds gameplay though, let's look at the other part.

#### 2.1.1 Earthbounds Combat

https://lparchive.org/Earthbound/Update%2021/16-capture_03042008_100928.png

Like all traditional jRPGs earthbounds gameplay exists in one of two states, in the "overworld" you walk around talking to people, maybe solving some puzzles. While in the overworld you can walk into an enemy who may or may not be also trying to walk into you to start a very abstract representation of a battle. Instead of having a sense of place, earthbound simply had sprites floating in front a 1994 SNES SFX-Chip-induced shader fever dream. Pairing this with the weird and unique enemy designs (c.f. above figure) made for an extremely unusally looking battle system. What took place underneath that asthetic however was a lot like traditional jRPGs, maybe even generic. Peopl usually don't feel that way when thinking about their time with Earthbound though. This is for multiple reason: First of all - again - the fact you're fighting all these crazy creatures inherently brings a lot of spice and memorability into a battle system, but earthbound tries on a mechanical level as well: A lot (and I mean "a lot" as in "too many") esoteric status ailments add to the usual rock-paper-scissor weakness-means-more-damage system reminiscent of Pokémon. While there's traditional status' like being asleep, poisoned and burning there's also: having fleas, having a runny nose, feeling homesick, having a mushroom grow on you, feeling "strange", having a sunstroke. The actual [mechanical effects](https://earthbound.fandom.com/wiki/Status_Ailment) of these is fairly unclear and I think most player could not name mechanical impact they have but that didn't matter, much like the choice of setting and choice of enemies the quirky status' added flavor rather than depth. And most people have to admit, it's fun to play a game on your snes that has your character get a runny nose mid-combat so all the status' were by all accounts worth the inclusion.

http://lparchive.org/Earthbound-(by-Leavemywife)/Update%2005/71-hproll.gif

Another often remember feature is the "rolling" health bar when loosing or gaining health rather then instantly adding the amount to the party-members health, it instead adds to them slowly in real time meaning while you menu or while attack animations are playing out the health slowly "rolls" up or down (c.f. the above gif). The intended emergent gameplay moment of this is for you take a huge hit that would ordinarily instantly kill your character and instead having the health roll down at rate that now incentivizes fast action, if you're quick enough (and you get lucky enough that the other animations aren't too long) you may be able to select a healing item at which point your health immediately starts ticking up instead, preventing certain death. I think most player will have at least one moment like this and for that alone it was worth the inclusion but I also think that much like the numerous weird status ailments it only provides the *illusion* of depth. If you were to replace the system with the traditional die-instantly way you would only have to barely if at all tweak numbers for fights to go the exact same way they are now outcome-wise, all that changes is the potential emotional impact. I don't want to critique this system too much, I think it is a good system but much like the status ailments it's inclusion is not to add depth but to add flavor. I think it's important to recognize this and (spoiler alert) it will be a fundamental principle in games that followed in earthbounds footsteps.

#### 2.1.2 Gygyas 

https://i.pinimg.com/originals/14/a4/f4/14a4f46bbdc0f77e93996fe1df22300a.gif

Gigyas is the penultimate villain and final boss of earthbound and it's honestly hard to describe what it even is. It's an abstract non-corporeal personification of evilness. You get to the final fight by first traveling into the future where all life on earth and even it's athmosphere is completely destroyed. Fighting it you get the first earthbound fight where there's no enemy sprite (except for pokey at during the first phase). Rather the shader-powered background is the enemy. Shigesato Itoi, Earthbounds designer, creditet the experience of walking into the wrong cinema and seeing a very violent scene as a young child as inspiration for Gigyas presentation and I think as such it is one of the best villains in all of gaming, not because of writing or mechanics but because of it's position relative to the game it's in. Up until this earthbound was really light hearted, there were some midly disturbing concepts like being in a cult and zombies but at 30s before midnight of the plot earthbound goes from Pokémon to Lovecraft out of nowhere. I think that this and only this is why it Gigyas has such an impact and I want to make note of the following: The things that make Earthbound special and memorable aren't inherently so due to the properties of the game, rather it's those properties relation to established norms, the established norms of traditiona jRPGs, of kids games, of it's owns plots tone. Earthbound is a traditional jRPG in every way but it tries very very hard to be unlike them. Rather than adding to the gameplay in a mechanically meaningful way it adds spice, so much spice in fact that instead of seeming try-hard it ascended to cult status and became one of the most influential games of all time. Hopefully I'm not coming off as too negative here but Earthbound is a good game *despite* it's gameplay, *despites* it's literal plot and what it showed the world was truely unique because of that.

..Until it wasn't unique anymore like 20 years later.

[3] Games with turn-based combat and 2d sprite-based graphics such as the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest Series, Chrono Trigger, Suikoden, Tales of Phantasia, Xenogears and most recently Octopath Traveler. Unlike my list of earthbound-likes I don't think I have to elaborate more on what I mean when I say "traditional jRPG"

### RPG Maker 

https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383730/ss_c65670a156c17d8a79a2fe44caee977bdae40c17.600x338.jpg?t=1598946198

So you really liked earthbound and you want to make your own Earthbound, what do you do? Well you could get a degree in CS and learn to program and spend 3 years in your bedroom creating a game from scratch OR you could just take earthbound and... make it yours by modifying the actual game for the SNES with hacking tools. This is called romhacking and I only want to mention earthbounds romhacking scene because of one very important actor that will have their start here but even in 2000 people wanted to make their own Earthbound and while they didn't technically need to be able to code it was still kinda hard for the non tech-literate. That is until in late 2000 [RPG Maker](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/) was created. Intended as 45% Engine, 45% development tool, 10% publishing platform RPG Maker boiled traditional jRPGs down  to their purest form. It was literally designed to be a tropy jRPG, turn-based combat, high-fantasy setting, tile-based movement, 2d-sprites, the works. It was also designed to be incredibly easy to use and it was, much like what Flash was for animators, with RPG Maker every person with a small amount of determination and even smaller amount of money can create their own game. However the games were inherently limited. Modifying the RPG Maker engine is hard, not only do the Terms of Service not really like that but it just doesn't give tools and absolute freedom some games need: Games had to run in a tiny window at native resolution, it was terribly optimized, displaying fonts broke constantly, features were slowly getting rolled out with bad backwards-compatibility, it wasn't a very good game engine back then (I heard it's pretty decent nowadays though) but what it was very good at was giving players who were really into that Earthbound game a tool to make their own. And they did. 

#### Yumei Nikki

https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/24373/2466891-yume_kyuu.png

http://www.bitcreature.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Yumi.jpg

Yumei Nikki was released by the highly emblematic "Kikiyama", the games name in japanese translates to "dream diaries" 
and while it's a very odd game I am of the opinion it is one of the most influential games of all time. Yumei Nikki
was made in a really old version RPG Maker but it has no abstract jRPGs battles even though they are trivial to implement
using the engine. Instead Yumei Nikki is what some may today call a walking simulator, you explore a set of vast worlds, 
visually distinct from each other but verys same-y within themself. Interaction with the environment happens through 
"costumes", collectable items you can pick up and equip that may just change the sprite of the player character or may
interact with other objects like a knife to attack certain enemies. Other TODO: JORDAN UNDER VIDEO have done great
at describing the game and what is appealing about it in more detail than I have time for here but I'd like to highlight 
a few specific things with it. In Yumei Nikki you play as a girl that is confirmed to be a Hikikomori, a young adult that
refuses to leave their room. In game you start in this room and to access the different worlds you use the titular dream
journal. This frames the worlds enviornment as being liminal and inherently surreal but also as a product of the main
characters psychology. In one world you can see a car crash victims body, lying on the street bleeding out and while
there is neither dialogue nor much in the way of interaction the framing of the game cements this imagery as a 
surreal representation of trauma of the main character and as Madotsuki (that's her name) is basically a blank slate 
it is reasonable to project that trauma onto the dev themself. The car crash scene moves the goalpost in a way where
now every single element of the mostly non-sensical world can now be interpreted and projected and I think that 
along with the trance-like experience of walking around surreal beautiful but highly repeptitious worlds with no
goal or purpose other than to see more is why theres a giant fan community around the game. I cannot overemphasize 
how huge this game is in certain circles, every character in the game be it important like the car crash victim or 
the almost main-stream famous TODO: SCARY DUDE THAT HAPPENS RANDOMLY all the way to irrelevant window-dressing characters
that are functionally equivalent to decoration but through the games framing and art become something anthromorpized 
in the audiences mind. Yumei Nikki is a very strange game, it has no relating to jRPGs other than also being seen through a 2d sprite-based 
tiled top down perspective and being made in RPG Maker but through being so strange and endearing it has become an 
influence on a whole generation of indie-devs. 

So starting with this paragraph I will highlight one or two properties of the games that were in the future (spoilers)
inherited by any earthbound-like that came after. If Earthbound is the Super Metroid then Yumei Nikki is the Castlevania
of the Metroidvania genre (note how I decided against the more obvious dark-souls comparison where earthbound is the dark souls 
and yumei nikki is the bloodborne of the soulsborne gen- ah fuck I did the dark souls comparison anyway fml). What I want you
take from this paragraph is this: What made earthbound special was it's quirkyness, it's uniqueness and how it iterated 
on jRPGs as a whole not by improving anything but be adding spice. Earthbound has a very literal story, there's not
many themes or big-ideas but there doesn't need to be when the world is this interesting and endearing. Yumei Nikki
has almost no mechanical gameplay, experiencing the game is experiencing the feeling, the liminal suggestions that 
barely reach your conscious as you wander around this surreal world. Earthbound can be surreal too like in moonside
but Yumei Nikki is "oops, all surrealism". Yumei Nikki is also (if intentionally or not) expressionist. Through framing
to the tiny amount of plot and being increadibly interpretable Yumei Nikki feels like a game made not to be entertaining
but to project ideas the developer had into the world in an almost unfiltered way while still being vague enough plot- 
and lore wise that what exactly is being communicated entirely depends on the audience. What we can be sure of however
is that what Yumei Nikkis world is trying to express is extremely personal, and most likely not to Madostuki but personal
to whoever made the game. 

#### OFF

OFF is another RPG maker game made by a basically anonymous person in a foreign country: France this time instead of 
Japan. OFF is not as influential or iconic as earthbound or Yumei Nikki but I'd still like to talk about here for what 
makes OFF relevant to the earthbound-like genre is not the game itself but the process of how it was created. I'd like
to show you two screenshots from OFF, hopefully without context. Try to only look at the first, read what I wrote and 
then look at the second:

TODO: screenshot of outside world

I think even a layman would instantly recognize that this is a RPG-Maker game. It's very basic, just solid colors 
and an overworld sprite so bland you could be forgiven if you think it was made as a placeholder. This is what OFF 
the game is. It is by all measurements a terrible game. The puzzles are terrible, the movement feels terrible (though 
this may be to blame the outdated version of RPG Maker the dev used), the dialogue is horrendous but I will touch on 
that later and yet still while I was playing of and being perplexed at how sub-standard a game can be to still garner 
such a big following something happened. I never forgot OFF. I kept thinking about and there's two reasons for that. 
The first and most obvious reason is the follow: (please consider watching this video for a few seconds as the music
is important to my point here).

TODO: OFF battle theme

It looks completely unique, it looks hand-drawn, doodled almost and that is because it was. The dev literally drew the 
characters on paper TODO: link and scanned them and put them in the game like that. He didn't use the drawings as a base
they literally scanned in the paper, sized it down to the resolution RPG maker wants and that's it. Now this might not 
be totally true but what I'm trying to say is that the games graphic give you that feeling. It seizes to be immersive
and instead displays the process of how it was made openly and unapologetically. This is also true for the dialogue, 
at best the dialogue can be awkward but at worst it can be incrompehensible. The reason for this I assume is because 
the game was first released in french. Many young french people have a substandard graps on the english language because
of what I assume are systemic reasons. Either way the dialogue feels like it's badly translated, not because it is 
wrong but because cadence, word-choice and nonsensical idioms are omnipresent. This goes for names and locations and
everything really. This again, can force the audience to interact with the process of how the game was created. It 
was one person, in france, who can't speake english very well who can't do pixelart either (as obvious from how all 
pixel-only graphics are very simplistic while the more intersting parts of the games artwork are all scanned-in irl 
drawings or prints) and who most likely can't programm very well weither. The games battle system is the bog-standard rpg 
maker system, the dev didn't even bother to implement more characters the other party members other than the main 
character with the baseball bat are just incorporeal circles. You wouldn't know this by just visuals but the battles
are completely imbalanced, there is no strategy you just click one of the like 5 moves there are in total. Puzzles in 
the overworld are often find-the-way-through-a-maze or remember-a-number-combination-and-punch-it-in-somehwere else. 
This all presented in the RPG-maker typical tiny window with bad font and the simplest movement system you can imaging 
(it's literaly Gen1 Pokémon) and OFF should have been a failure yet it wasn't. Financially it probably was but culturally
to this day there's a big community around the game, people cosplay as most of the characters and even I who probably 
sounded very dismissive of the game in this paragraph can still positiely say it had a huge impact on me and I will never
forget it. 
What OFF (and many other games like SUITS (which is a game were literally all graphics are scanned-in doodles) and many
other RPG Maker games) brings to the earthbound-like genetic lineage in my opinion is focus on the process of creating 
the game. If people play Resident Evil or Final Fantasy they don't think about the people who made the sprite, how many
people worked on it or where the game is from. The experience the game on it's own terms and while OFF may have tried 
in the end it doesn't do this. It exposes itself much like a Jackson Pollocks painting in a way where the impression 
it leaves on the audience is very intense by not only offering a compelling audio-visual experience (OFF has great music
btw) but by making the audience engaging with it not as an experience or product but as someones work. "A single person 
made this, I can see how they made it" and even if the process itself is simplistic or flawed that does not mean
the game cannot have an enourmous impact on whoever experiences it.

(right now I'd like to point out a very specific thing. Much like TODO in Yumei Nikki who can only be encountered through
very obscure means OFF has a character called "Rebecca Sugar" which has their own battle theme and it's basically a 
hidden boss and in my experience the only challenging part of the game. Keep this in mind, this trend of "Super Hard 
obscure Character that had way too much effort put into them for how few people will see it during their playthrough")

#### Super Mario RPG, Super Star Saga and Paper Mario 64

Taking a break from the no-budget indie games I'd like to circle back to a first-party game that had all the funding in 
the world and matching success. In 1996 Nintendo joined forces with the at that point incredibly critically acclaimed
square who was just fresh of Final Fantasy 6, one if not the best jRPG of all time to use their lovable plumber in a...
turn-based battle system. Mario is about jumping and I think the devs new that and in response they had an ingenious idea. 
First of they also had a bad idea which was that in the overworld you can jump around. If you want to pick up an item you 
instead have to jump on a block, etc.. Getting that bad idea out of the way they created on of the in my opinion best 
mechanics ever implemented for a turn-based game: action commands. Instead of just menu'ing and hitting A you have to
time your a-press in what could be described as a quick-time even nowadays. The QTE is completely diagetic, there's no 
"hit A now" instead you have to time for example mario landing on top of an enemy as close to the enemies head as possible.
If you do it really well you get rewarded with extra damage or effects, if you do it badly the attack may fail completely
and if you do kinda decently you get kinda decent damage. Not only does the QTE affect the numbers but a different 
animation triggers. There's a power in the game that was carried over to Super Mario 64 (the games spritiual sequel in 
2.5d on N64 this time) where if you hit the QTE of jumping on someone perfectly you get to jump another time, and then 
again, and again and everytime it gets a tigher input then the last until finally it's frame-perfect. If you hit that 
input however it just keeps going and speedrunners use this to effortlessly steamroll through bosses doing literally 
100 jumps in succession and an appropriate amount of damage. Apart from this system (which is not only active on
attacking btw, defending, spells, almost everything works like this) the game is a fairly standard jRPGs. A mana-equivalent,
a potion-equivalent, roaming enemies that if you run into them a battle starts, banging music, the works. However what 
makes this game adjacent to an Earthbound-like is it's world an story. Once again it operates on an extremely 
literal level displaying a very odd, quirky world that is not taking itself serious whatsoever like final fantasy 
but that is more fleshed out and in some ways adult than a regular mario game. Before expressing what this game 
brought to the lineage I'd like to talk about it's spiritual sequels, on game boy advance in 2003 there was 
"Mario & Luigi: Super Star Saga", one of the best looking pixel art games of all time and a game that was written so well
that it gave Bowser a personality that endures to this day. It had a completely unique universe that instead of being
mushroom-themed was bean theme, some enemies kinda looked like mario ones but there were also completely unique enemies, 
characters, it was an explosion of personality and creativity rarely afforded to first-party mario games. 

TODO: Wine boss

Super Star Sagas combat iterated on Mario RPGs by instead of just requiring pressing the A button for QTEs also pressing 
B button which sounds super standard until you hear that A exclusively controls mario and B exclusively controls Luigi.
So if an enemy spits two fire balls slightly apart and the first one hits mario and the second one hits luigi the player
will have to defend first with A then with B. If moves hit both of them this can get very challenging and similarly 
QTEs in the overworld along with powers used for navigation also follow the "A for mario, B for luigi" principle. It's 
an ingenious way of controlling 2 characters on a system that had the same amount of buttons as the NES. 
Paper Mario 64 may have been a huge shift in looks but in gameplay it is nearly identical. Again the QTE system carries
the combat and makes these games appealing to people who don't like jRPGs because "there's finally gameplay in the 
battles, you guys". Also like Super Star Saga and Mario RPG before it Paper Mario 64 has a wholly unique world, new 
enemies new bosses some like what we've seen from other mario games some unlike anything we've seen. Even between these
three games the worlds rarely share characters, each one reinvents the wheel of the setting and major characters and 
all three nail it effortlessly. 
Which trait did the Supar Mario RPG Series (no I won't talk about the current year sequels) bring to the lineage? To 
put it simply, they added gameplay where there was none. I may have misrepresented the games a bit by using the word QTE
but it really doesn't feel like one, battling is a mechanical challenge. Navigating the overworld is a mechanical challenge,
so is solving puzzles. It doesn't feel like any of the games mentioned here already because many people would 
consider the series almost action games. I also think that this is why many people who would hate Final Fantasy 6 love
Paper Mario 64. It's bright, it's quirky and not only does it break with tradition in terms of setting but also 
mechanically and I think they way Nintendo and Square bridged that gap already on the SNES was simply genius.

I'd like to qualify something, actually. I personally do not agree with the saying that pure jRPGs Battles "have no gameplay"
however my problem with this is a semantic one. More accurately put, pure jRPGs Battles "have no reflex challenges". 
Playing Earthbound there is very little happening in the players hands, maybe they try to menu a bit faster because of the
rolling health but that's it. Playing a Mario RPG every attack, ever move an enemy works is inherently linked to a mechanical
challenge much akin to jumping in a traditional mario game. A good jRPG does have gameplay, it just happens in the 
players head, strategizing, waiging options, instead of their hands. The keen eyed among you may have already guessed 
what I'm going to say next: Earthbound really doesn't have gameplay, be it mental or reflex-based. Yumei Nikki does not 
have gameplay, OFF does not have gameplay. These games are both mechanically and intellectually very simple. This of 
course doesn't make them bad games at all. What it result in however is that it makes them niche games. Most of the gaming
audience does not want to play a game like that and I think that's part of threason this lineage of games is surrounded 
by a subculture that's this tightly knit. Anyone who likes Yumei Nikki already exhbiti a large amount of patience and 
willingless to engage with a game that is not challenging whatsoever and I think that precisely because of this the 
 Mario RPG Series is so pivotal. It's a jRPG, it has a quirky and creative world, it does not engage with very head-y 
 concepts, it's highly visually appealing and it's writing is sharp and playful. Just this time it's also actually fun 
 for your hands. From here on in the lineage earthbound-likes feel like they have to do more. Just rpg maker combat is 
 seen as suboptimal and is objectively suboptimal if you're trying to 
 reach a bigger market. Mario RPG solved a problem that was only this pronounced in earthbound-likes: battles and walking
 around can be fun - even for normal people.
 
### LISA: The Painful

(content warning: descriptions of gore, sexual violence and domestic abuse)

LISA is another RPG Maker game whoever I consider it fairly distinct and I think most people who aren't intimiately 
familiar with the engine or read up on it will not immediately notice that LISA is made in it. For one the perspective
is shifted from a top down view to 2d side-view similar to the original mario games. Another thing that makes LISA 
stand out from the crowd of RPG Maker games is it's "combo system". Instead of simply selecting an attack or consumable
from a static list the player instead has to input a combination of buttons, for example WAA could be a punch and WSS 
could be a kick and so on. Not every permutation of {W, A, S, D} has a corresponding attack but that is precisely the point
in my opinion. You could argue that this is pointed, in the end it is functionally equivalent to just selecting an attack
but I would disagree with this. For one the most obvious advantage of this system is simulating mechanical challenge. 
It is not actually hard to input certain moves and there's even a list of all combinations however pressing 4 keys 
each time you attack and having it be accompanied by a flashy combination simulates what the Mario RPG series did so
execellently: there is now a tactile component to the RPG Maker combat and I think while intellectually it doesn't 
seem that valuable from a player experience point of view it improves the game. 
Now you may by no have noticed a trend in my writing, I don't really want to talk about a game in detail or review, I 
don't really want to talk about a game in detail or review it rather I want to first find out why a game is an 
earthbound-like and then identify what part of that game became a gene passed down in future generations of earthbound-likes.
For LISA, this is not the combo system. It's not the 2D view and the light platforming that comes with that rather it is
it's adult themes. It's still quirky but lisa has explicit gore, violence, rape, body horror, etc.. None of this will 
be actually disturbing to most people because it is after all a low-res RPG Maker game that looks kinda same-y but the 
game does a good job of framing these disturbing things in a way were they actually land. For example in one scene the
protagonist is trying to find out where another character is being held and to do this he captures and then tortures one
of the enemy combatants. Not only is it an explicit cutscene of just that happening but the player actively takes part 
in it having to hit a QTE for each punch the main character (henceforth "MC") inflicts on the captive. 
In a similar scene the MC has a flashback to his childhood of living in a low-income house with a father that is explicitely 
abusive both emotionally and phsyically (and most likely sexually as can be inferred from subtext in LISAs predecessor).
This is shown, you actually see your father belittle you and throw a bottle at you and you manually walk the MC to a 
playground to get beaten up and bullied. I am not comfortable of inferring things of a still-livign artists personal life
but the framing implies this as very personal and similar to Yumei Nikki this intimitacy acts as an amplifier for how 
serious the player takes the violence. LISA can be funny, gross and is almost always quirky but what makes it special
enough to change the course of the genre of earthbound-likes is how it dealt with explicit, highly disturbing subject 
matter in a way that in no way minimized them and made it feel personally by having the player play through the revelant
sequences.

Also I shouldn't just leave it merely implied, LISA is more graphic than most people would expect, it doesn't go as far
as to literally show sexual violence but characters get their arms cut off, their face melted, shoot themself in the head
and slowly bleed out on the floor while their intestent are hanging out of their punctured belly. I don't consider 
violence for violences sake a feature that improves a work of art but by staying respesctful when it is warranted (like
with sexual abuse or domestic violence against children) and balancing out the gore and blood with enough absurdity and
jokes LISA kind of ripped off the band-aid. Since LISA (there are almost certainly games before it that did this of course), nothing it taboo anymore. Earthbound-likes are free to show whatever they want and making a game that is explicitely adult-only is not only commercially viable but is respected by the audience.

### And so came many others

With dev-tools improving and earthbound-likes finding indie success RPG Maker games went from being an underground thing
for people who "aren't able to make real games" to a valid genre. As such many many other followed, some of them were 
simple made-by-one-teenager games that don't really have anything good to offer but still had love and effort poured into
them. RPG Maker games stopped being jRPGs, titles like "To the moon" used the tool to tell a straight forward drama that 
is more akin to a traditional walking simulator and had writing that is legendary for making most people cry and as such
will fit right in with "Gone Home" and similar titles. Professional artists came out of the woodworks and used RPG Maker
not only as an outlet but as a job, creating games like "Omori" landing 6-figure kickstarter campaigns and having
multi-person teams working on not only the game but ports and merchandise and nowadays in 2021 RPG Maker seized to be
a trope, a type of game and is now an engine for 2D games, just like Unity or Unreal. I'm glossing over many excellent 
titles for the sake of brevity but let me just list off a bunch of them as I do actually want to make a point:

i) Oneshot: a "roguelike" game where you can only die once, the game locks up afterwards so you really do only have "one shot"
ii) Yumei 2kki, an official sequel sanctioned by the original dev
iii) Jimmy and the Pulsating Mess, a true earthbound-like in that it is very much like earthbound, luckily earthbound is good
enough for that to be a hook, not a negative
iv) Mother4 (now renamed to TODO): an actual sequel the the warmly regarded but cast-into-obscurity-by-nintendo to the 
next game in the Mother series: mother 3. Mother4 was a multi-person project that was put on hold when the chance of
getting a seize-and-desist by nintendo seem likely enough to warrant filing off the serial numbers in order to transform
the project into something commercially viable
v) Ib, a spritiual sequel to yumei nikki that took the afterthough that was melee combat and made it a core-feature of the 
gameplay, completely substituting turn-based-combat instead
vi) "The Witches House", "Mad Father", "Angels of Death" three game whos devs are unrelated but that all brought true horror
into the RPG Maker format. These games are much closer to resident evil than to final fantasy and much like LISA do not 
hold back in the violence and disturbing subject matter 

All games I've listed in this chapter (and all previous chapters) are great games. I may not love some of them but 
I consider them important and worth the time and money that was spend to create them. They are the cream that rose to the 
top out of an arguably endless see of half-abandoned or naively implement RPG Maker games/clones and I cannot stress 
enough how many there were. Seeing that you can actually sell these games for real money many devs tried to promote their
hobby-project they just made to learn how to do pixel art into a job. I will never condemn artistic ambition but I think
I echo many more mainstream-gamers thoughts when I state that earthbound-like went from a type of game to a vast community,
if you wanted to do you can have your entire life revolve around them, all your friends are into them, you live on the RPG 
Maker forums, you watch youtubers (TODO: link NitroRad, Jordan Under) that cover them, you found your boyfriend on an 
RPG Maker discord server and you haven't touched your oil colors and brushes because you only do pixel art now. I'm being
facetious but there really was a community here, it was still a niche hobby but it was very much not obscure anymore. However...

### Then came Undertale 
The big one, one of the most influential games of all time in my opinion and *the* supposed rags-to-riches story of a 
guy in his bedroom playing around with first RPG Maker and then Game Maker that made a game that blew up and sold over 
a million copies. Now first I would like to explicitely state that the time-line I am implying in this essay is not 
perfectly chronological. It wasn't that LISA came first and only then came all the adult RPG Maker games and similarly 
it was just Undertale that started the boom but I still think it's valuable to regard Undertale as a giant TODO-shift. 

Undertale was made by two people, a programmer/designer/writer and an graphical artists and at first it doesn't seem that
special. Undertales replaced the Mario RPG QTEs in battle with little SHMUP sections. Instead of just attacking you 
could now befriend enemies too, maybe a mob doesn't need to be slain but rather just needs a hug. Undertales world was
rich and filled with creativity and memorable characters. However undertale was still a small game, it had very few 
bells and whistles and doesn't really feel like a product but as something someone really wanted to make'. And it just 
happened to be made in a way that made lightning strike. Every undertale character has their own community, Sans is 
in super smash brothers, the fact that tumblr and deviant art almost spilled over with the amount of undertale fanart is
so well-known that people will use phrases like "night in the woods is the new undertale". "golf story is the new undertale".
I will admit I'm creating a strawman by reproducing these quotes without attribution but for the sake of argument I would 
like to examine what that means. "X is the new undertale" does not only imply that x is most likely an earthbound-like 
adjacent game, a personal story made by a small indie team with quirky characters and emotional, relatable
themes, amazing music and graphics but also that it is derivative. By the point undertale broke into the mainstream 
the earthbound-like became formulaic. People will often point to undertale as an intentional subversion of many tropes,
killing monsters actually has a detremental effect in canon, you get to talk instead of attack, the game is very meta 
with characters leaving files on your computer or intentionally crashing the game however if you were exposed to earthbound-likes
that came before it you will recognize every one of these tropes, most likely from multiple games. Like all art, Undertale 
is iterative, it build on what came before it and I think the reason people found it so fresh is that undertale was new
to the mainstream. Most people don't play RPG Maker games, most people will call Yumei Nikki a terrible pointless game 
but Undertale was so accesible, so relatable, so much of lightning in a bottle that it ascended all of these properties 
and like all the great earthbound-likes before it it brought something new to the genepool. 

I want to break character for a moment here and talk about myself. I don't like undertale. I would never call it bad 
or fault someone for having it be their favorite thing but I think because undertale was such a huge success critical 
mass was hit and suddenly most of the earthbound-like community wasn't there because of the rich history but because of 
undertale. This isn't a bad thing, it's always good to grow but what this resulted in were games not iterating upon 
all the earthbound-likes that came before but on undertale specifically. A game had to be quirky, have a consistent world,
look nice, have great music, be technically a jRPG but have a "gimmick" on top of the regular combat, be character-driven
not as a character study but as a journey that interacted with characters, have a very literal plot by which I mean all
 events are perceived as happening diagetically, they had to deal with emotional mental-ill related themes like 
 anxiety, social awkwardness, feeling lonely or without purpose and what I'm trying to say is that since undertale, 
 this is the definition of an earthbound-like. Undertale was the culmination of what came before it, it had every gene 
 mentioned in this piece at conception but because Undertale attracted so many players that were not able to recognize 
 this fact it effectively erased much of the genres history and replaced it with "like undertale". It's why my friend 
 who I mentioned in the first paragraphed recognised omori as "another one of those". I'm not saying Omori is that 
 derivative but I mention it to illustrate who from someone looking in, someone who never played a good RPG Maker game,
 someone who thinks turn-based combat is boring and archaic, for a person like this, Omori is "another one". In the 
 same paragraph I also said that the definition of earthbound-likes are a see-it-and-you-know-it type. I still stand 
 by this however since Undertale, I think we'll be able to get a proper definition. Something clearly define, something
 very close to the list of properties I just listed of. Let's go through them again, one-by-one:
 
 ### An actual Definition
 
 (content warning: math)
 
 A game can be considered an earthbound-like if it has enough of the following features:
 
 a) It is build on a framework that is considered like those of jRPGs, meaning...
    a1) It has 2d, sprite-based, low resolution pixelart style graphics
    a2) it is build around two distinct states ("scene"), in the "overworld" the player moves through a diagetic world, 
    usually on 2 axis, solves light puzzles and interacts with other characters by for example talking to them or triggering 
    the second states "battle" in which the player engages in an abstract representation of what diagetically is violence, 
    social interaction or any another form of the one or more player entities interacting with one or more non-player entities
    a3) Movement on the overworld is fairly basic
    a4) there is very little mechanical challenge and mechanical depth in any gameplay system
    a5) puzzles may be present however are rarely the focus of the game
    a6) Can have their inspirations followed back to either DnD, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest or...
b) ...is directly or indirectly iterating on Mother 2: Earthbound, meaning
    b1) Is has world that is not featured in traditional fantasy- or horror- games
    b2) Is very character driven were chapters may revolve around a certain character instead of an activity
    b3) have a very literal plot, meaning all actions during the plot are diagetic and non-metaphorical
    b4) have a quirky world that has both comedic and dramatic writing
    b5) intends to represent an intensiely intimate and personal experience 
    b6) has moments of overt horror and dark or surprisingly disturbing subject matter
c) focus a lot of it's presentation on static illustration and music, rarely animation or technical fidelity
d) is aimed at a niche non-mainstream audience of younger (born after ~1989) players of any gender
e) are made by a small team of either indie developers or if first party by a director that has not participated in many 
mainstream projects

Okay. There we have, it an actual definition. While reading you most likely already picked one of the properties and 
thought of a game I mentioned here that does not fullfill it so I'd like to again restate how malleable this and any genre
really is. Games can be multiple genres at once, even if they're more obscure. You can be a souls-like metroidvania, a 
platformer racer, etc.. Secondly, who am I to just state a definition as this and tell others that that's what it means 
and other should abide by that. I'm not, I mean I objectively am but what I do not have is the authority or intend to 
force my opinion on others. What I tried to achieve in this piece instead is give a very surface-level history of a lineage 
of games that I think most people would consider related, how (but not in what order) the iterated on each other and how
it all culimated in many great, truly amazing games. Like any genre, earthbound-likes have tropes. Often these will be 
perceived as for example "another game about depression/social anxiety" or "nother jrpg with boring combat" and sometimes
a game will subvert these tropes and sometimes they will reproduce them exactly but offer something else in a way where 
it eclipses the staleness and instead becomes something special. Hopefully with this you will now be able to not only 
recognize an earthbound-like but be aware of the depth and history it carries with it and you hopefully will be motivated
by this new game to go back and explore older games like it. Going mainstream isn't it a bad thing, it's just a thing and 
if that means more people get to play these games and more importantly, more developers get to make more I consider that 
very important. 

### Epilogue: Is rat_game an earthbound-like?

(content warning:  descpritions of sexual violence towards minors, genocide)

I'd like to say a quick thank you for reading, I know it was a lot. Hopefully I remember to hid this part somewhat as 
I don't think it will be relevant to a lot of people so feel free to skip this. If you decided not to then let me clear 
my concious by saying that I lied to you. In the very first paragraph my friend on seeing a screenshot of Omori said 
"Looks neat but man I just get the vibe it's a generic JRPG in a cool package". I then stated that I intuitively ask 
myself two question. This is not true, I asked myself one additional question: "Is that what rat_game is too?". What my 
friend said caused a lot of anxiety, for me rat_game is something very special, something so intensely personal that 
I don't want any of my irl friends to play it so they don't find out things about me I wouldn't share myself and being 
told that that was just another one what basically means undertale clone was something I had to process. Now the mathematician 
in me would try to rationally prove or disprove this by going through my above definition and checking if all of the 
properties apply to rat_game but I think that's missing the forest for the trees. I shouldn't focus on "is rat_game an earthbound-like" but rather on "is rat_game another generic earthbound-like". I tried my best to sound neutral and 
not to condescending in this essay but I have played a lot of earthbound-likes both for fun and for research and on top
of noticing the properties I outlined in my definition I noticed another thing: Most of them are about mildly disturbing 
things like curable mental-illnesses, midly disturbing violence like car accidents or the death of a family member and 
most of them don't really try to be head-y high art: Earthbound doesn't really have themes, it's not a commentary on 
anything, really, it just tried to be a quirky fun game and during that it made fun of some of the genre tropes (like
waiting behind the waterfall for 30mins irl) while replicating others by the letter (like it being possible to just 
grind your way through everything). This doesn't make earthbound worse of course, not everything has to try to be 
on that level but... I do. Most of the plot of rat_game is a metaphor for events of my life. rat_game isn't just about
social anxiety or depression, it's about incurable diseases like schizophrenia or severe PTSD, how things like that 
make your entire life impossible as every single thing in your reality is colored by it and also how despite 
that people persevere and try to find happiness. rat_game has violence but, idk, at first I wanted to go all out. There's 
a brothel in rat_game and during the chapter where you explore it you go further and furhter down into the ground and 
I want each floor to get lower "morally", too. LIke the first floor is vanilla prostitues, then a few floors down it's 
bdsm, a few floors down it's underage teens and snuff films and what comes even below that I will leave to your 
imagination. While this is included in the plot know that I would never explicitely show it without having a very, very
good reason for it. Look towards a film like "irreversiblé" to see how much of a point art has to have to justify having
a realistic rape scene and I think this is true for all subject matter this extreme. The plot of rat_game involves 
genocide, during the calamity 60% of all humans were executed. Hell, the second to last chapter takes places exclusively 
in a giant hole basically where all the bodies were dumped. I don't think most earthbound-likes would go that far but
that's not really important, I'm not just bringing these up to go "oh see how much more mature I am" I'm bringing this
up because at no point did I see something in another earthbound-like and go "I want that too in my game". Form the
beginning I know what I wanted, I wanted to make a game about, me basically. Not literally about me but about my life
experience and by chance most of the things that happened in my life are way way worse than what many people would even
tolerate in fiction. And thus, most of the things that happen in rat_game are way way worse than what many people woud
have tolerated in... earthbound. Or undertale. Or a mainstream RPG Maker game. What I'm trying to say is that rat_game
is indeed an earthbound-like, there's is no question. However it isn't an earhtbound because I wanted to make an 
earthbound-like, I wanted to make rat_game and at least consciously I tried so in a vaccuum away from genre tropes 
or marketability and while I can't guruantee it I at least have hope that that will make it "not just another jRPG about depression" but I guess we all have to find out once it's done.
