<p style="max-width:80%;display:inline-block">
Earthbound (1994, SNES) has been hugely influential on both niche indie games and large mainstream AAA successes. This article proposes that a lineage of games, inherently linked by the specific design decision and artistics ideas they share, form a new genre "Earthbound-likes". As Earthbound, Yumei Nikki, various commercial RPG Maker games such as OFF and LISA, the Mario RPG series and lastly Undertale are examined, properties that went on to be inherited by their successors and thus became part of the lineage are identified and collected to form a definition, a checklist of what makes a game an "Earthbound-like". The exact nature of the definition is stated and argued to be specific enough to warrant to be considered a genre. <br><br>
This article aims to give future generations a way to appreciate these often somewhat niche games for what they contributed to the genres successes and what they will surely go on to contribute to many games to come.

<h2 id="Motivation"> 1 Motivation</h2>

I want to start this piece on a personal note, I was casually talking to a friend and I opened the conversation by showing them the following screenshot of a "omori" (which is by all accounts a very good game) completely out of context:

<center>
<img src="https://robots.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Combat.jpg" alt="Omori Battle Scene">
<br><b>Figure 1.0</b>: <i>Battle Scene from {{<external href="http://www.omori-game.com/" text="Omori"/>}} that I showed to my friend.</i>
</center>

I just thought it looks nice, right? Their reaction was a lot stronger than I anticipated: "Looks neat but man I just get the vibe it's a generic western jRPG in a cool package".
I poked further and they went on to elaborate that they feel it's just another one of "those" games, midly disturbing subject matter, quirky world, shallow jRPG combat and an amazing visual presentation. I do not necessarily agree with any of these and obviously m friend hasn't played the game so I wouldn't even consider it their opinion, really, but even after the conversation went on I kept thinking about what they said. It implies that Omori is part of a lineage, that a out-of-context screenshot of it's battle system is enough evidence to not only know what game it is but to also judge it as so alike every other game in that lineage that it becomes generic and deals with very specific subject matter.

In this piece I will not argue for or against Omori or talk about it much at all, I won't disclose if I agree with my friend or if they changed their opinion after doing more research, rather I would like to neutrally examine how we got here and what exactly my friend was comparing Omori to.

<h2 id="Examples"> 1.1 Some Examples</h2>

As you may have guessed from the title, I will call the genre Omori is part of "Earthbound-likes". I think most will be familiar with the term "souls-like" which does have fairly clearly formulated properties <a href="#[1]">[1]</a> but for the sake of argument I will simply give a single line definition: "A souls-like game is a game that was inspired by Dark Souls". An Earthbounhd-like, then, is a game inspired by Mother 2: Earthbound, though much like with souls-likes it goes deeper than that. 
As I will aim to illustrate Earthbound-likes follow a very clear timeline and sequence of influences, Earthbound way first, then other games came that were inspired by only it and similarly to bloodborne for souls-like or castleania for metroidvanias, those subsequent became part of the genre identity. Hopefully by the end and as I name more and more games you yourself will form somewhat of a list of properties that make an earthbound-likes. Properties so specific that they do warrant to become a sub-genre themself. 

For now, here is a non-exhaustive, non-ordered list of games I consider Earthbound-likes:

+ The Mother Series (Mother 1, Mother 2: Earthbound, Mother 3)
+ Mario RPG (SNES), Paper Mario 64, Paper Mario: TTYD, Mario & Luigi: Super Star Saga, M&L: Bowsers Inside Story, M&L: Partners in Time
+ Most if not all of the commercially released RPG-Maker games, including but not limited to:

I think most people that are familiar with these games can already form a somewhat clear picture of what I mean when I say Earthbound-like but let's build my definition step by step, with the first step being, of course:

<h2 id="Earthbound"> 2 Earthbound</h2>
~~Earthbound is the Dark-Souls of ...~~ When Earthbound released it tanked in sales, became relatively obscure almost immediately and didn't even get a PAL import because Nintendo didn't want to bother. To this day Mother 3 which is objectively a great game and whos Protagonist is in Smash Bros still has not received official localization, that's how traumatic Earthbounds lack of success was to them. Many blamed this on the <a href="https://earthboundcentral.com/2010/03/earthbound-in-nintendo-power-73/" target="_blank">stink-based</a> advertising but I personally believe it was mostly due to the fact that the game was non-optionally bundled with a strategy guide thus raising the price above what similar games would've costed off the same shelf. Most children in 1994 weren't willing to take a risk and spend their entires years gaming-budget on a game actively marketed as super weird and unlike any other game they knew. 
That last point is not technically true however, Earthbound was a whole lot like it's prequel: Mother 1 for the NES (later released as <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/NES/EarthBound-Beginnings-1025416.html" target="_blank">Earthbound Beginnings</a> on the Nintendo Eshop. I don't want to dwell to deep on Earthbound history and Mother 1, there are <a href="https://earthboundcentral.com" target="_blank">entire websites</a> dedicated to it and this piece will already be long enough as is but what I want you to want to note here is that Earthbound wasn't iconic when it came out, no, it took some time to become iconic. I personally played the game for the first time in 2014 on an emulator however I was relatively late to the party most people who would eventually get *really* into Earthbound played it around the start of the 2000s.

</center>

So what made Earthbound special? Fo one it was a good game but I think what made it stand out is how unlike traditional jRPG <a href="#[2]">[2]</a> it really was. It was set in suburban america, you had to actually put your money into an ATM, enemies were rabid dogs, angry ducks, homeless people, three psychicly connected moles, full-sized dinosaurs, a guy that lives inside a dungeon and the dungeon is also a statue/robot that walks around, you get the idea. It's story was almost nonsensical, an episodic fever dream of walking around a surreal world erasing pencil-shaped roadblocks made out of metal and waiting behind a waterfall for 1h in real time to fight a literal pile of vomit. Earthbound was odd, quirky and - unlike it's advertising - incredibly charming. Pairing that good graphics even by todays standards and one of the best soundtracks in all of gaming and you get a cult classic. While all of these things are important, they only made up half of Earthbound gameplay.

<h2 id="Earthbound Combat"> 2.1 Earthbounds Combat</h2>

<center>
<img src="https://lparchive.org/Earthbound/Update%2021/16-capture_03042008_100928.png
">
<br><b>Figure 2.1</b>: <i>Battle against a Moonside "Crazed [Street] Sign" in Earthbound.</i>
</center>

Like all traditional jRPGs, gameplay in Earthbound is in one of two states: in the "overworld" you walk around talking to people, maybe solving some puzzles. While in the overworld you can walk into (or otherwise interact with) an enemy (who may or may not be also trying to interact with you) to start a very... abstract representation of a battle. Instead of having a sense of place, Earthbound simply has static sprites floating in front of a 1994 SNES SFX-Chip-induced shader fever dream. Pairing this with the weird and unique enemy designs (c.f. Fig. 2.1) made for an extremely unusally <b>looking</b> battle system. What took place underneath that asthetic however was a very much like a traditional jRPG, one might maybe even call it generic; people usually don't feel that way when thinking about their memories with Earthbound though. This is for multiple reason: first the fact you're fighting all these crazy creatures really does inherently bring a lot of spice and memorability into battles. Along the Pokémon-esque rock-paper-scissor weakness-means-more-damage system Earthbound also includes a lot (and I mean "a lot" as in "too many") esoteric status ailments in a somewhat vain effort to add complexity. While there's traditional status' like being asleep, poisoned and burning there's also: having fleas, having a runny nose, feeling homesick, having a mushroom grow on you, feeling "strange", having a sunstroke. The actual <a href="https://earthbound.fandom.com/wiki/Status_Ailment" target="_blank">mechanical purpose</a> of these is fairly unclear and I think most player could not name the actual gameplay impact most of these have but that didn't really matter, much like the choice of setting and enemies the quirky status' added flavor rather than depth - which isn't a bad thing. It is fun to play a game on your SNES and find out mid-battle that your character can have a runny nose and miss a turn because they're sniffling and if for no other reason than this, all the status' were worth the inclusion in my opinion.

">
<br><b>Figure 2.1.1</b>: <i>Animated .gif showing the rolling health meter. (source: lparchive)</i>
</center>

Another often remember feature is the "rolling" health bar (c.f. Fig. 2.2). When loosing or gaining health, rather than instantly adding the given amount to the party-members healthbar it instead adds to it slowly and in real time. "Real time" meaning that while you menu or wait for attack animations to play out the health slowly "rolls" up or down. The intended emergent gameplay moment of this is for you take a huge hit that would ordinarily instantly kill your character and instead having the health roll down at rate that now incentivizes fast action, if you're quick enough (and you get lucky enough that the other animations aren't too long) you may be able to select a healing item at which point your health immediately starts rolling up instead, avoiding death. I think most player will have at least one moment like this and for that alone this system was worth the inclusion but I also think that much like the numerous weird status ailments it only provides the *illusion* of depth. If you were to replace the system with the traditional die-instantly way of taking damage you would would only need to redesign a single-digit number of encounters <a href="#[3]">[3]</a>ver an entire playthrough in order for them to go the exact same way, all that really changes is the potential emotional impact. I don't want to critique this system too much, I think it is a good system but much like the status ailments it's inclusion did not result in adding significant death, it resulted in adding flavor. I think it's important to recognize this and (spoiler alert) it will be a fundamental principle in games that followed in Earthbound footsteps.

<h2 id=Giygas>2.2 Giygas</h2>

<center>

<br><b>Figure 2.1.2</b>: <i>Animated .gif showing the background texture and shader during the battle against Giygas. Note the vague shape of a fetus with a brain and umbilical cord in the pattern.</i>
</center>

Giygas is the penultimate villain and final boss of Earthbound and it's honestly hard to describe what it even is in lore. It's an abstract, non-corporeal personification of evilness in general. You get to the final fight by first traveling into the future where all life on earth and even the athmosphere is completely destroyed, you enter a womb-like structure and fighting against it it's the first and only Earthbound fight that is not just a static sprite in front of a shader background (except for pokey at during the first phase). Rather, the shader background *is* the enemy producing an effect of overwhelming size and etherealness. Shigesato Itoi, Earthbounds designer, credited the experience of walking into the wrong cinema and seeing a very violent scene as a young child as inspiration for Giygas presentation and I think it is one of the most memorable villains in all of gaming, not because of writing or mechanics but because of it's position and the tone of the encounter relative to the game it resides in. Up until this fight Earthbound was really light hearted, there were some midly disturbing concepts like being in a cult and zombies but at five-seconds-before-midnight hour of the plot Earthbound goes from Pokémon Villains to full Lovecraft out of nowhere. I personally think that this and only this is why it Giygas has such an impact. The things that make Earthbound special and memorable aren't inherent to their properties, rather it's those properties in relation the established norms of traditiona jRPGs, of kids games, of Earthbounds own plots tone. Earthbound is a traditional jRPG in every way except in affect, it tries very very hard to be unlike them and for most people it succeeds. Rather than adding to the gameplay in a mechanically meaningful way it adds spice, so much spice in fact that instead of seeming try-hard it blew past that and ascended to cult status and became one of the most influential games of all time. 
I may have been coming of as negative so far but I do want to explicitely state that Earthbounds deserves this. Earthbound is an amazing game, amazing despite it's gameplay and that gameplay barely matters if all other parts are this unique

... that is until it wasn't unique anymore like 10 years later.
<div id="earthbound list"></div>
Let's quickly take inventory of some of Earthbounds properties though:
+ quirky and light-hearted world<br>
+ surreal, character-introduction-driven plot (each chapter corresponds to one party member)<br>
+ very literal plot (there are no big themes or metaphors tackled)<br>
+ shallow jRPG battle system with great presentation<br>
+ mechanics are added for flavor, not for depth<br>
+ plot suddenly shifts to very dark subject matter during the final moments<br>

So you really liked Earthbound and you want to make your own Earthbound, what do you do? Well you could get a degree in CS and learn to program and spend 3 years in your bedroom creating a game from scratch OR you could just take Earthbound and... make it yours by modifying the actual game for the SNES with hacking tools. This is called romhacking and I only want to mention Earthbound romhacking scene because of one very important actor that will have their start here, nevertheless even in 2000 people wanted to make their own Earthbound and while they didn't technically need to be able to code it was still kinda hard for the non tech-literate. 
That is until in late 2000 [RPG Maker](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/) was created. Intended as 45% Engine, 45% development tool, 10% publishing platform, RPG Maker boiled traditional jRPGs down to their purest form. It was literally designed to be the tropiest of jRPGs, turn-based combat, high-fantasy setting, tile-based movement, 2d-sprites, the works. It was also designed to be incredibly easy to use, much like what Flash did for animators, with RPG Maker every person with a small amount of determination and even smaller amount of money can create their own game. However the games were inherently limited. Modifying the RPG Maker engine is hard, not only do the Terms of Service not really like that you try but it just doesn't give the tools and absolute freedom some games need. For example (and this is true especially for earlier versionss of the engine) games had to run in a tiny window at native resolution, the engine was terribly optimized, displaying fonts broke constantly, features were slowly getting rolled out with limited backwards-compatibility. That is to say it wasn't a very good game engine back then (I heard it's pretty decent nowadays though) but what it was very good at was giving players who were really into Earthbound but not at all into computer science a tool to make their own. And so they did. 

<h2 id="Yume Nikki">3.1 Yume Nikki</h2>

<center>

<br><b>Figure 3.1</b>: <i><a href="https://yumenikki.fandom.com/wiki/KyuuKyuu-kun" target="_blank">KyūKyū-kun</a>, a non-interactable NPC in Yume Nikki who rubs a staricase, emitting a scrubbing noise similar to plastic gloves on glass (source: giantbomb)</i>
</center>

Yume Nikki was released by the highly emblematic "Kikiyama", the games name in japanese translates to "dream diaries" and fitting of it's title it's incomprehensible yet incredibly emotionally affecting. It was made with a very old version of RPG Maker and I can't help but think that that is why Yume Nikki chose to completely forgo one of the defining features of jRPGs: turn-based combat. Yume Nikki is a jRPG excep it's all overworld. There's basically no puzzles and in the game you just kinda walk around, looking at things. Today some would call Yume Nikki a walking simulator, you explore a set of vast worlds, 
visually distinct from each other but very same-y within themself. Limited Interaction with the environment happens through 
"costumes", collectable items you can pick up and equip that may just change the sprite of the player character or may
interact with other objects like for example brandishing a knife to attack certain enemies. [Others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPlibu9VeOI) have done great
work describing this game and what is appealing about it far better than I ever could so instead I would like to focus on a few very specific things: In Yume Nikki you play as a girl that is confirmed to be a Hikikomori, a young adult that basically refuses to leave their room instead exclusively engaging in solitude and media. In game you start in this room and to access the different worlds you use the titular dream journal. This way of accessing the actual games worlds frames them as inherently surreal, but most importently explicitely as a product of the main characters psychology. For example in one world you can see a car crash victims body lying on the street bleeding out and while there is neither dialogue nor much in the way of interaction the framing of the game cements this imagery as a 
 representation of trauma of the main character and as Madotsuki (that's her name) is basically a blank slate and the project feels so much like outsider-art it is reasonable to project that trauma onto the dev themself. The car crash scene moves the goalpost in a way where now every single element of the mostly non-sensical world can possibly be interpreted and projected like this. I think that along with the trance-like experience of walking around surreal beautiful but highly repeptitious worlds with athmospheric music and no goal or purpose other than to see more is why this game is so special. There is a giant, very passionate fan-community around this game, both in japan and the US. I genuinely cannot overemphasize how huge this game is in certain circles, every character in the game be it important even if they literally have no purpose other than being a visual element. Most notably is the almost main-stream famous <a href="https://yumenikki.fandom.com/wiki/Uboa" target="_blank">Uboa</a> who is so obscure I won't even go into him more right here. No matter how purposeless the visual elements are, all become functionally equivalent in the audiences mind because all of them become an expressionist element in the exploration of Madotsukis mind.
Yume Nikki is a very strange game, it has no relation to traditional jRPGs other than also being seen through a 2d sprite-based 
tiled top down perspective and being made in RPG Maker but by being so strange yet endearing it has become an 
influence on a whole generation of indie-devs. Maybe it is because of the RPG Maker community but over the years most games inspired by earthbound were made by people who were also in turn inspired by Yume Nikki and I think seeing this game as the Castlevania of Metroidvanias, the Bloodborne of Souls-like, one of the ur-members of the Earthbound-like lineage sheds light on not only it's influence but on what made the game interesting even in 2003.

</center>

Similar to the chapter on Earthbound I would like to take inventory of Yume Nikkis properties:
+ surreal world that is a metaphorical exploration of the main character damaged psyche<br>
+ made in RPG Maker by a single person overseas<br>
+ no mechanical or strategic challenge<br>

As we continue with these inventories, you'll hopefully see where I am going with this. First let's look at another early-gen RPG-Maker game made by an anonymous developer in a non-english speaking country though:

<h2 id="OFF">3.2 OFF</h2>

OFF is a bad game. OFF is also an important game. I don't actually want to judge the games quality but unlike Yume Nikki I don't consider it a pillar of the genre, rather I would like to use OFF as a case-study to stand in for many, many other RPG Maker games that are in the same vein.
I'd like to show you two screenshots from OFF, hopefully without context. Try to only look at the first, read the paragraph below it and then look at the second 

<center>
<img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/e57f6bcf729b4a758a65efd7bc12ee5f/tumblr_pwnrmjS1b41uuwlpwo1_640.png">
<br><b>Figure 3.2</b>: <i>OFFs overworld</i>
</center>

I think most would recognize that this is a RPG-Maker game. It's very basic, just solid colors and an overworld sprite so bland you could be forgiven if you think it's as a placeholder. Movement feels terrible, the puzzles are terrible, the dialogue is horrendously translated and it runs in a tiny 400px x 300px window that cannot be maximized. Now let me show you the second glimpse of the game:

<small>(thank you to [Kairin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3AALruIRZN-GMcxxZlzO7Q) for providing this footage)</small>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aICiWtsv4mI?start=1535" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Now, I don't actually know how long you've kept watching but hopefully you experience at least some of the spark this game emits. It's still rough, the sprites for the party are literally just circles and a pixelated .png, it's still a vanilla RPG Maker with terrible balancing and very little in terms of strategy but despite all of this it looks and sounds completely unique. The hand-drawn if not doodled look was achieved by <a href="https://off.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Concept_Art" target="_blank">literally drawing the sprites on paper</a> and scanning the pages, down-res them and put them in the game. Now this might not be totally true but what I'm trying to make not of here is that the games graphic do give you that feeling. It's not immersizve whatsoever, instead the process of creating the game was made obvious and instantly recognizable. If you actually play the game not just the battles do this, cutscenes will have scanned in prints from old libraries, the dialogue reads like someone with a decent knowledge of french and suboptimal knowledge of english spend 2 evenings translating all the files in the RPG Maker repo but none of that matters for the experience of the game. It's process over product, form over meaning and much like Yume Nikki it confronts the audience directly with who made it. In OFFs case one might say a bored french musician who just needed an outlet and in Yumei Nikkis case opinions vary from a traumatized japanese hikikomori who wanted to translate his dispair into a game to just a talented artists with a strong sense of how to do expressionism well but what is true in any of these cases is that the game becomes an examination of the person who created it. RPG Maker games are rarely made by studios, they're rarely made by experience devs, most often they are made by a single person with no budget and no coding experience who wanted to make something important enough for them to pour hundreds of hours of effort into creating it.

Let's do our inventory for OFF:
+ surreal world that is simply a framework to show of the developers irl illustrations and music<br>
+ made in RPG Maker by a single person over-seas<br>
+ no mechanical or strategic challenge<br>

I've cheekily copy pasted some of those points in order to strengthen my thesis but let's keep going anyway:

<h2 id="Mario RPG">4 Super Mario RPG, Super Star Saga and Paper Mario 64</h2>

Taking a break from the no-budget indie games I'd like to circle back to a first-party game that had all the funding in 
the world and (unlike earthbound) the matching success. In 1996 Nintendo joined forces with the at that point incredibly critically acclaimed square who was just fresh of Final Fantasy 3, one of the best jRPG of all time, to use the lovable plumber known for jumping when you press A in a...turn-based battle system? I think the devs were aware of this discrepancy and proceeded to solve the issue with a fresh and ingenious idea they went on to carry an entire franchise worth of sequels.

<br><b>Figure 4.0</b>: <i>A basic battle against a flying koopa enemy in Super Mario RPG (SNES). Note that in order to execute the shell kick at maximum damage the player has to time the A press with the animation of the shell hitting the floor in front of mario.</i>

They created on of the in my opinion best mechanics ever implemented for a turn-based game: action commands. Instead of just menu'ing and hitting A to select a movve you have to now also an additional A-press in what may be described as a quick time event (QTE) nowadays. In Super Mario RPG (SNES) said QTE was pretty much diagetic, there's no "hit A now" prompt, instead you have to time the press based on the animation happening on screen. This system is fuzzy, much like a rhythm game the closer to perfect you do the input the more damage will the move will do. As the game went on, action commands got more and more complex, from simply pressing A once when attacking or defending to pressing A <a href="https://papermariorta.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Mario_RPG:_Legend_of_the_Seven_Stars#100_Jumps" target="_blank">frame-perfectly 100 times</a> in order to execute the highest damaging combo which is used by speed runners to obliterate every boss in no time. Later games in the series would incorporate more than just one button and with better technology better animations were possible to accompany them.
I would like to quickly distinguish between traditional QTEs (as seen in Resident Evil 4 for example) and action commands. In my opinion it comes down to this: a) does failing the button press result in a fail-state and b) does perfectly executing the command result in an additional effect on top of the default outcome. In RE4 if you don't press the button fast enough you get eaten by the big fish and have to reload a save, hitting it perfectly is the default state, you don't get any additional effect it's simply a challenge to overcome so the game can continue. In action games like Bayonetta, failing the QTE will result in a fail-state however doing the QTE well (for example hitting a button really fast) will not only let you continue with the game but get a bonus reward of extra currency or points. In the Mario RPG series and many Earthbound-likes in general, failing the QTE does not result in a fail-state, for some moves it does not result in any punishment compared to the default at all. You can play mother 3 without ever hitting a single QTE, it'll play just like Earthbound but if you do hit that games rhythm based action command your attack will deal extra damage. That's the difference, failing a traditional QTE results in a fail-state, winning continues the game. Failing an action command doesn't do anything, completing it result in a bonus. This is a spectrum with something like bayonetta being square in the middle. Either way the point of action commands was to replicate another more mainstream genres gameplay and even in 1996 it succeeds at that, replicating what would ordinarily be timing a jump in a mario platformer by instead tying the input and animation to an attack in the context of a jRPG combat system.

I will not attribute this quote to anyone directly but a general sentiment about why jRPGs have become niche is that players expect "actual gameplay instead of just pressing A on a menu". While the validity of this claim is questionable I think what is meant by this is that traditional jRPGs do not offer mechanical challenge while most other genres of games, especially the big profitable ones, are by their very core about mechanical challenge first and foremost. Games about strategy and simulation tend to be more niche and I think herein lies the problem, it's not that many traditional jRPGs lack mechanical challenge, it's that that mechanical challenge is rarely (especially in Earthbound-likes) substituted with strategic gameplay. Few would call a Paradox a game about clicking on menus because it offers strategic and intellectual depth instead. Earthbound-likes, at least those we've looked at here, do not offer strategic depth. That doesn't make them bad games it just means it leaves their mass-market appeal below those of more traditional games - until Mario RPG and later (and probably most succesfully) Paper Mario 64 presented the same Earthbound-like package except this time fights stimulate your hands as well. It worked, big-time, I know many people who would never finish an RPG Maker game or even call themself interested in RPGs but who love Paper Mario to death and unlike Earthbound Nintendo to this day keeps some of their first party studios busy developing Mario RPG games for their consoles. 

I don't think that "final fantasy but with mario and QTEs" fully represents the true appeal of the Mario RPG series. Unlike most other Nintendo properties the writers of the games and especially Super Mario RPG and Super Star Saga were given complete freedom. Both games do share enemies and elements with other Mario Games but they might as well take place in a paralell dimension, completely new art styles and fully fledged characters in place of the personality-less Mario characters like Bowser or Mario himself flesh out a world that was very much it's own thing - with a light Mario coat of paint for marketability.

<br><b>Figure 4.2</b>: <i>Battle against <a href="https://mario.fandom.com/wiki/Culex" target="_blank">Culex</a>, a hidden boss battle that vastly differs in visual presentation and difficulty from the base game and any Mario game.</i>
</center>

What I'm trying to say is that the Mario RPG series are unlike other Mario games, instead they are very much alike Earthbound-likes: A surreal, very literal plot, quirky setting and visual design, meta-commentary on the genre of jRPGs, the works. Mario & Luigi: Super Star Saga even has the sudden unexpectedly disturbing final boss fight (c.f. Figure 4.3 below). I can't say if the devs were directly inspired by Earthbound but what I can state with confidence, however, is that future Earthbound-likes were very much inspired by the Mario RPG series. Suddenly, non-strategic jRPG combat felt less tolerable, you don't have to make it complicated but you do have to make it unique and/or "more". Not all games did the same system as Mario RPG, they may insert a <a href="https://wikibound.info/wiki/Sound_Battle" target="_blank">rhythm mini game</a>, a <a href="https://jcw87.github.io/c2-sans-fight/" target="_blank">shmup or platformer</a>, a <a href="https://lisa-rpg.fandom.com/wiki/Armstrong_Style" target="_blank">fighting game</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-09-22-undertale-walkthrough-pacifist-guide-tips-4873?page=5#:~:text=There's%2020G%20hidden%20in%20the,Style%20outfit%20examine%20his%20hat." target="_blank">dating sim</a>, anything really. What genre to pull gameplay from is truly arbitrary and I think the wide variety of what devs would translate Mario RPGs action commands into shows how Earthbound-like combat isn't able to stand on it's own in a post-Mario RPG world.. I want to explicitely state again: jRPG combat doesn't have to be hard or complex, games don't have to have good combat to be good games at all. I want to instead just neutrally remark that adding mechanically interesting gameplay on top of the quintessential and thus generic jRPG gameplay without modifying that base is a very common trait for Earthbound-likes. That is what Mario RPG went on to bring to the lineage, action commands are genius and it turns out they do especially well at making vanilla jRPG combat more exciting and appealing.

Instead of taking a multiple points inventory I'd instead just like to note a single property of the Mario RPG Series: The battle system was made interesting not through strategic or conceptual complexity but through insertion of out-of-genre mechanically interesting gameplay. 

<h2 id="LISA"> 5 LISA: The Painful</h2>

(content warning: depictions of gore, descriptions of sexual violence and domestic abuse. skip to [here](#6) to avoid them)

LISA (2014) is another RPG Maker game, it was made in RPG Make VX Ace which unlike the version Yume Nikki and OFF were made in does offer developers a lot more freedom. LISA breaks with the trend of top-down 45° angle graphics and instead migrates to a 2d side-view, also including light platforming elements. Just like Mario RPG Lisa slotted another genre into battles, this time more akin to fighting game combos or maybe comapring it to DDR would be more correct. You enter button combinations and depending on which permutation was inputted, the character will do a certain special attack.

<br><b>Figure 5.0 </b>: <i>The player inputs a series of button presses to trigger a special attack "dropkick" and deal additional damage in LISA. (source: comic vine)</i>
</center>

While at first glance both the platforming and combo system make LISA a fairly unique RPG Maker game I don't don't actually want to bring LISA up because of this. What makes LISA unique, especially in 2014 was the subject matter and how dark LISA was truly willing to be. Without going into story details, LISA focuses explicit scene of the Protagonist torturing or murdering someone in their way, of being gunned down and slowly bleeding out, enemy factions commiting essentially genocide and through out the game there are flashbacks to the protagonists live which show domestic abuse, a child that was never loved and ravagely beaten by their friends and family, you get the idea. I don't consider LISA a very profound game, it explicitely contrasts these dark themes with levity, jokes about someone pooping in the open and homoerotic barbers construction a middle finger out of their combined hair yet still underneath all the edgyness is a core that many players will find emotionally exposing and real.

</center>

Like OFF, Lisa was made by essentially one person, also like OFF not very much is known about them. They intentionally used fictional characters from the game to <a href="https://widdly2diddly.bandcamp.com/album/lisa-soundtrack" target="_blank">release their music</a>, yet the sincerity and realism of how domestic abuse was portrayed in LISA let many people form a parasocial relationship with the perceived identity of the dev. I'd like to clarify here that I am not saying that either the dev or someone close to them has experienced domestic abuse, rather I'm pointing out the through death of the author the devs persona, the entity that seemingly made a game about all these intensely personal things, will have some audience members project those experience onto them. Yume Nikki dealt with loneliness and to some extend trauma but LISA not only went more towards the trauma side but showed it in explicit, disturbing detail. As we've gone through the other games so far every game had a design decision or idea that went on to be inherited. LISA does not have many original design decision, what LISA contributed is taking the lid of the darkest side of Earthbounds-likes. Giygas was dark for that game but LISA was dark, even for the real world. It took away the stigma of RPG Maker games having to imitate Earthbound in a way where most of it is quirky and child-friendly and then some of it is surprisingly dark. Since LISA, everything can be pretty much as dark you want. LISA was a huge success and it showed devs that doing this is not only commercially viable but has a chance to have a huge impact on their audience. 
Also I shouldn't just leave it merely implied, not only the subject matter but the imagery of LISA is explicitely adult. It doesn't depict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irr%C3%A9versible", target="_blank">graphic rape scenes</a> or realistic gore but for what is achievable in RPG Maker and with pixel art LISA went farther than any Earthbound-like has gone so far.

Just as before I'd like to take inventory of properties LISA exhibits before we continue:
+ profoundly dark and disturbing subject matter that is thematically motivated by the main characters psyche<br>
+ quirky and sometimes funny plot<br>
+ little strategic challenge<br>
+ inserts an out-of-genre system to make battle more mechanically interesting<br>
+ made in RPG Maker by a single person<br>

<h2 id="Others"> 6 And then came many others</h2>

With dev-tools improving and Earthbound-likes finding widespread indie success RPG Maker games went from being an underground thing for devs who supposedly "aren't able to make real games" to a valid engine, delivery tool and genre. As such, many such games followed suit, from simple made-by-one-teenager games that don't really have anything good to offer but still had enough love and effort poured into them to have been worth the time and purchase to multi-person teams with tens of thousands worth of budget and capital to be spend on artists and writers. RPG Maker stopped being exclusively for amateurs and much like Yume Nikki did all this time ago many games wouldn't really be classified as jRPGs at all. Titles like "To the Moon" are more of a 2d interactive story than an RPG, yet it saw mainstream success and is regarded as one of the most emotionally impactful games from that decade. Here is a non-ordered list with a quick blurb to highlight many of the not exclusively RPG Maker games that came out during this period:

i) Oneshot: a "roguelike" RPG Maker game where you can only die once, the game locks up afterwards so you really do only have "one shot"
ii) Yume 2kki, an official sequel sanctioned by the original dev 
iii) Mother4, a direct sequel to Mother3 made by a team of talented non-nintendo devs. Sadly while nintendo refuses to support the mother series they do still seize and desist anything that tries to do it for them (#freemelee) 
iv)"The Witches House", "Mad Father", "Angels of Death" three game whos devs are to my knowledge completely unrelated yet all had the same idea of bringing a resident evil style pure horror game into the earthbound-like RPG Maker format

Lastly "Omori" despite my friends initial opinion of it earned 200 000$ on kickstarter and was not only delivired to critically acclaim but is now being ported to non-PC consoles and is by all measures a huge success. By this point in time Earthbound-likes have seized to be niche at all, they are a full industry and a pillar of gaming and for every obscure bland direct earthbound copy there is a wholely original (if strongly inspired) game that enriched many peoples lifes. One title however stands far above them all, so ubiquitously succesfull and impactful that many see it as the culmination and potential implosion of the earthbound-like genre.

<h2 id="Undertale"> 7 Undertale</h2> 
Arguably one of the most influential indie games (if not all games) of all time and in *the* supposed rags-to-riches story of one guy (along with his artist) making a game he cared about in his bedroom and selling over a million copies, Undertales reputation precedes it. As mentioned earlier in this piece, the Developer of Undertale did not, in fact, came out of nowhere, he found his footing in the Earthbound romhack community and amassed a sizable audience there. That audience led him to start the snowball on kickstarter and maybe against his expectations, it grew into an avalanche. 
Undertale is one of those things that's so small but grew so big that fans had to extrapolate every tiny element from it, every single character of even the lowest significance has an undertale fandom around them, the game blew up in the tumblr/twitter scene so much that when Night in the Woods released I saw countless of reviews saying "play this before the fandom ruins it like undertale". I don't share the opinion that the reaction to undertale in anyway colored the game and I'm not really here to examine that. See, I'm in a very priviledged position. I played undertale completely out of context. I bought it the day it came out because it was on sale and I literally read no reviews or checked the internet before I finished it. It wasn't even intentional I just thought it's another obscure rpg maker (it was actually made in game maker) title that a few thousand people will play and as demonstrated in this piece I like those games. So what was Undertale: the game, not the phenomenon.

Undertale is the quintessential Earthbound-like, it's creator literally went from Earthbound to it and the influence is obvious. Undertale features strategically shallow combat that is spiced up not with funny status effects this time but with two Mario RPG-esque, out-of-genre elements. The most obvious is the shoot-em-up mode, when you get attacked instead of just taking the damage you enter a small window where you control a heart away from incoming projectiles This is very much alike Gradius, Touhou-games and the like but it woudln't appeal to any of their audience. It's less about being a compelling shoot-em-up (and it really doesn't have to be) but about not being a bog-standard jRPG. The shump window is undertales action-commands and it even used the infamously hard nature of those games as a way to create <a href="https://jcw87.github.io/c2-sans-fight/">one of the most iconic bossfights in all of gaming</a>. While the shmup section is used for defending, for attacking undertale put two spins on the genre. The first and arguably blandest one is that if you attack to deal deamage you get a typical action-command on the level of Super Mario RPG (SNES). The more intersting one is that each battle has an entirely seperate mode in which enemies aren't defeated by killing them but by having social interactions with them. I don't consider the moral component of this very notable, it plainly displays the two options of killing them or sparing them in literal text so it has about the same impact as it did in Bioshock, however what the spare-system offers is a situation in where players are actively incentivized to form para-social relationship with characters. Much like Earthbound each chapter of Undertale is based around a certain character and as each chapter culminates in a bossfight, it also culminates in a chance to get to know that chapters characters. I think this is why undertale spawned such a dedicated fanbase, taking the mechanics of the game on it's on merits completely out of context it literally tasks players to become a fan of undertales characters as gameplay. 

Undertale came out in 2015 which means that right now in 2021 we're well past the 2-3 year development cycle of most videogames. There are many games inspired specifically by Undertale and I'd like to examine what this means for the Earthbound-like genre. Unlike for example LISA, undertale exhibits properties of Earthbound-likes that are more representative of 2001 instead of 2015. It is very much like Earthbound and it does have the action commands of the Mario RPG series however it is not an exploration of someones psyche, it is neither surreal not deals with explicitely disturbing or generally adult themes. Undertales story is incredibly literal, everything that happens happens diagetically, while it is true that especially flowey interacts a lot on the meta level (by for example crashing the players game) I think nobody would argue that Undertale is a character study, disturbing or very profound. The fact it s neither of these does not make it a bad game, against the opinion of a lot of people outside it's (or any earthbound-likes) audience, Undertale is quite good. I'm simply noting that in the chronology of Earthbound-likes Undertale does not bring anything new to the lineage. Undertale directly follows Earthbound itselfs and this becomes relevant when we consider the sheer size of Undertales audience. I can't back this up with statistics obviously but for the sake of argument let's say 50% of Undertales audience have not played any game discussed in this article except Undertale. Many of those 50% may go back and play Earthbound but I don't think many of those people will also go back and get really into Yume Nikki or will share a deep appreciation of LISAs adult themes. Undertale can be viewed as a branching of the genre, games following it will either be Earthbound-likes or the will be inspired by Undertale specifically. This posits a problem, if Undertale is an Earthbound-like and games are excusively influende by Undertale, are those games also Earthbound-likes? I can't answer this definitevely but I think it's worth considering that Undertale represents a branching of the genre that somewhat erases it's history. Undertale is so much like Earthbound it basically skipped all the properties I've outline in this article and just because it was so, so immensily popular this effect will be felt for many years to come. I don't know what the future of Earthbound-likes will hold but I think there will be games that follow in the Earthbound-likes footsteps and there will be games that follow Undertale and I also think that the latter may not necessarily do the former. Undertale is a good game, I don't want to stigmatize it for "ruining" the genre or anything, it doesn't. Just by the fact that Undertale happened to gain more popularity than all other indie games in this genre combined marks a shift for Earhtbound-likes in general and we may be already feeling the effects of that  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/459080/YIIK_A_Postmodern_RPG/" target="_blank">shift manifesting in negative ways</a>. This, however, is okay. Genres shift and I can't with good consciounce genuinely be worried about many, beautiful games to come that even if they are inspired by Undertale first, are still good games. 

Remember when I showed my friend a screenshot of Omori and they called it "another one of those"? I think what they were talking about was "another one of those like Undertale" because they're not aware of the detailed and varying history of Earthbound-likes in general. If you've only ever been exposed to Undertale and games that exclusively followed Undertale but not LISA, Yumei Nikki, etc. then you may have formed the same opinion, games that are all so alike Undertale they feel interchangable and games that ignore the genres legacy and thus feel shallow because Earthbound was indeed shallow. Omori is not one of those games but to someone who isn't familiar with all the niche games mentioned here it may seem that way from the outside looking in. Let's do our inventory <a href="#earthbound list">one last time</a>:

+ quirky and light-hearted world<br>
+ surreal, character-introduction-driven plot (each chapter corresponds to "bossfight")<br>
+ very literal plot (there are no big themes or metaphors tackled)<br>
+ shallow jRPG battle system with great presentation<br>
+ mechanics are added for flavor, not for depth<br>
+ plot suddenly shifts to very dark subject matter during the final moments<br>

Hopefully you see my point. 
 
<h2 id="Definition">8 An actual Definition</h2>
 
 Through out this article we have not only looked at important games that got us to the point where we are today by inspiring each other and subsequent games but I have tried to systematically highlight things each game passed on, their "genes" so to say. If we pool these together in a set and try to find a least common denominator we can assume that this is as close to the definition of what I call "Earthbound-likes" as we can get. Let's look at what exactly it means:
 
A game can be considered an earthbound-like if it has enough of the following features:
 
a) ... it usually has 2D, sprite-based, low resolution, pixelart graphics

b) It is build around two distinct states, in the "overworld" the player moves through a diagetic world, usually on 2 axis, solves light puzzles and interacts with other characters by walking into them or for example talking to them or triggering the second state, "battle", in which the player engages in an abstract representation of what diagetically is a violent fight or another form of confrontation suchs as social interactions. Note that the "battle" state can be absent completey in certain games (like Yume Nikki), the overworld part however is not optional.

c) Movement on the overworld is mechanically basic

d) ... there is very little strategic depth in the battle system
d1) However these systems are enriched by an out-of-genre mechanic such as from shoot-em-ups, fighting games, dating sims, etc.
d2) The vanilla version of the battle system (the battle system without the out-of-genre gameplay) is similar to those found in early Final Fantasy, D&D, Dragon Quest or RPG Maker games

e) ... it is directly or transitively[5](#[5]) iterating on Mother 2: Earthbound and Notable RPG Maker games, meaning it... 
    e1) has a world that is considered unusual compared to traditional fantasy jRPGs
    e2) Is very character driven, chapters or entire plothreads may revolve around a meeting or introducing certain character instead instead of a driving external goal
    e3) have a quirky world that has both comedic and dramatic in writing
    e4) intends to be an emotionally impactful and intensely personal[6](#[6]) experience
    e5) has moments of overt horror and dark or surprisingly disturbing subject matter
    
f) ... it focuses a lot of it's presentation on static illustration and music rather than elaborate animation or high fidelity graphics

g) ... it is made by a small team of either indie developers or if made by a first-party studio, developers that are usually established for their work in other AAA successes
g1) many of these developer found their footing in the earthbound-, rpg-maker- or undertale-community 


There we have, case closed. R-right? You might have noticed that I used a lot of law- and math-definition tricks by using weasel words and not commiting to stating if all or even how many of these properties have to be present in a game for it to be designated as an "Earthbound-like". I consider this valid however, genres aren't a label intended to classify a piece and put it in a box and only that box, they are meant to give context to the pieces place in history and it's inspirations and relation to other similar art. Nontheless, every single game mentioned in this article either fullfills all of these properties or came out before a time where on of it's to-be sucessoors would introduce the missing property into the genre and have all subsequent games inherit it. There wasn't out-of-genre mechanics before Mario RPG (there probably were games I don't know about but you get my point), before LISA Earhtbound-likes weren't willing to dabble with themes this explicitely disturbing (again there probably were some), you get the idea. As the genre evolved and more amazing games were made those games in turn inspired future games and the list of properties grew and grew to a point where today. I consider the above definition not only well-established but incredibly specific. Specific enough that some (including me) think it should be enough to call it it's own genre.
Either way my intention isn't to establish a new term. What is actually important to me is for young audience members who for example got really into undertale but none of the games mentioned here to maybe go back and try them. Don't just emulate Earthbound and think you have the full context of even just Undertale. I'm positive anyone who liked Undertale will like the Mario RPG games, if they're old enough I would also warmly recommend LISA. After all the actual point of putting a label on a game is to make it so if someone likes that game, they know they should try out games with the same genre. Hopefully this article made that a little bit easier to do and I again warmly recommend every single game mentioned by name here. I have tried to stay neutral despite my potentiall positive or negative opinion on a certain title but either way I do consider all of these games at least worth your time to try and I am hopeful that in the future developers who did try them will bring us even more games that advance the genre just like all these classics.
