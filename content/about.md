# Programming Skills

<span style="font-size:20px">[<span style="color:#F33C72">▮</span>▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯]</span>   : Novice<br>
Syntax and paradigms as well as general features are known to me and I'm able to understand
 averagely complex code written by other people. I have setup this language on my computer before
 and know how to compile or run programs. I have not worked with this language for longer than a few weeks

<span style="font-size:20px">[<span style="color:#F33C72">▮▮▮▮▮</span>▯▯▯▯▯]</span>    : Intermediate <br>
I know how to write complex programs in this application and how to interpret common compiler 
errors. I know most big features of the standard library and how to use them and I've used common external modules
related to my field. I have worked with this language for multiple months

<span style="font-size:20px">[<span style="color:#F33C72">▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮</span>]</span>    : Expert <br>
    : Expert
I know this language very well, I can write code fluently without looking things up much at all. I have 
experience with the inner workings of the language and am familiar with every standard library feature 
and more obscure idiosyncracies. Similarly I have seen almost every compiler error there is and have dealt
 I am familiar with many 3rd party libraries related to my field. I have worked with this language for years.

>3 years of experience including 1.5a years of using it daily as a full-time job on a big multi-person project. 
It's my language of choice and I consider myself highly familiar with it including compile-time execution, bleeding edge 
 performance optimization, meta template programming, 
not yet rolled out C++20 features and many 3rd party libraries such as Boost, Abseil, Google Benchmark & Test, SeqAn3 and 
Lua- and XML Interfaces. TODO: hyperlinks
