## Soft-Skills and Expectations

I highly prefer working in an environment that is consistently challenging and problem-oriented in a way where I'm not only intellectually working on capacity but forced to evolve an learn new things on the fly. I enjoy being given a complex problem along with a certain amount of time to answer it and then left to get to that answer through my own process; an example would be someone handing me a few terrabyte of medical data and asking a specific question about that population or being asked to implement a certain functionality in the most performant way without specifying the exact process that fills the blackbox between input and output. <br>
I enjoy working in a team like this because often being able to bounced ideas off another person aids in iterating faster and veering off potential dead ends thanks to another persons perception. I tend to get invested into my work and having a social component to it helps a lot with that.

I am currently located in Berlin and unable to move until at least 2022. I'm more interesting in a position that's fun and challenging than necessarily that well-paying and it would be possible to work later than usual or even at night in order to for example communicate with oversea teams. 

Below you will find more specific technical information about my hard skills, if you would like to contact me feel free to navigate to the contact page through [this link](../contact) or the header above.

## Programming Languages

<h3 style="float:right; position:relative; top:-1em">[<span style="color:#F33C72;">▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▯</span>]</h3>
<h3>C++</h3>
<p>
Over 3 years of experience including 2 years of using it daily as a full-time job on a multi-person project. 
I decided early on that this was the language I would focus most of my education and expertise on and I now consider myself highly familiar with it. I have a strong graps on more complex topics such as compile-time execution, template meta programming, paralell computing and bleeding edge optimization. I also strongly believe in well-documenting, testing and benchmarking code and keeping it as pretty and good-practice as possible at all times. I furthermore have experience with somewhat new C++20 features such as ranges and concepts and I've used 3rd party libraries such as 
{{< external href="www.boost.org" text="Boost"/>}}, 
{{< external href="https://abseil.io/" text="Abseil"/>}}, 
{{< external href="https://github.com/google/benchmark" text="Google Benchmark"/>}} and
{{< external href="https://github.com/google/googletest" text="Test"/>}},
{{< external href="https://sol2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" text="Sol3 Lua Binding"/>}} and {{< external href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/" text="SFML"/>}} as well as {{< external href="https://www.opengl.org//" text="OpenGL"/>}}
</p>

<h3 style="float:right; position:relative; top:-1em">[<span style="color:#F33C72;">▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▯▯▯</span>]</h3>
<h3>R</h3>
<p>
Over 2 years of experience. I started truly having to master it because I was a TA in Statistics in college and the class was tought in part in R and when I later on found myself having to do data processing and visualizing I stuck to R simply out of familiarity. It is now my go-to for applications that are not performance critical and I feel confident in being able to not only answer questions someone may have about a certain data set but also visualize them in a way that gives people that may be outside of my field the same insight as someone who is more familiar with the math-side of things. 
I'm capable of using the shipped R-modules but prefer to stick to 
{{< external href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/" text="ggplot2"/>}} and 
{{< external href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/" text="other tidyverse modules"/>}} to create expressive graphics and self-contained data processing pipelines. 
</p>

<h3 style="float:right; position:relative; top:-1em">[<span style="color:#F33C72;">▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▯▯▯</span>]</h3>
<h3>Lua</h3>
<p>
I choose Lua as as secondary data-representation language for my Game but have since come to appreciate the freedom and versatility a non-compiled language with reflection and introspection this deep holds. I've move AI and file-interfacing components of my engine to be exclusively written in lua and I've written polymorphic self-generating code in a project that started out as just wanting to have a function that serializes a function-pointer into runnable code but turned out to be closer to a non-malicious computer virus. 
Being c-based and having native C-interfaces as well as third party C++-interfaces lua has become my script language of choice and the fact it is so lightweight and performant makes me hopeful that it will fill a crucial part in my later career.
</p>

<h3 style="float:right; position:relative; top:-1em">[<span style="color:#F33C72;">▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▯▯▯</span>]</h3>
<h3>GLSL</h3>
<p>
While not very relevant in data science applications I have used GLSL in 2d environments to create complex shaders and
through the restrictions inherent to the language I feel that I now have a strong grasp on paralell execution in distributed 
system as each OpenGL fragment is basically a little node running the same GLSL script completely independent to all other nodes, just like in a distributed system. 
</p>

<h3 style="float:right; position:relative; top:-1em">[<span style="color:#F33C72;">▮▮▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯</span>]</h3>
<h3>Swift</h3>
<p>
During an internship scraping the server of a radiologists office I was tasked to exclusively develop for mac and as such
became familiar with both Objective-C and it's de-facto replacement swift in a professional context. While I consider
myself capable of working on a Objective-C project I would vastly prefer to just do it in swift instead, swift is a beautifully designed language and if it wasn't for it's restriction to both MacOS and XCode I would make it my main language. Through Swift I have furthermore become acquainted with both Cocoa and the XCode toolchains.
</p>

<h3 style="float:right; position:relative; top:-1em">[<span style="color:#F33C72;">▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯▯▯</span>]</h3>
<h3>Java</h3>
<p>
I started out learning Java at TU Berlin during my first few semesters of a pure math degree so I do have experience with it but later in life basically decided to forgo it for the sake of C++. If I was to work on a project that already established it's infrastructure strictly in Java I'm confident I will be able to work with it after brief acclimation.
</p>

<h3 style="float:right; position:relative; top:-1em">[<span style="color:#F33C72;">▮▮▮▯▯▯▯▯▯▯</span>]</h3>
<h3>Python</h3>
<p>
I've used Python mostly for medical-/genomic-data processing especiall in College because it has one of the best back-catalogues for libraries but have since moved my focus onto instead using R and C++ for the same purpose. This choice was somewhat arbitary and I would welcome an opportunity that gives me a reason to truly master Python to round out my toolbox of languages.
</p>

<p>
<h3 style="float:right; position:relative; top:-1em">[<span style="color:#F33C72;">▮▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯</span>]</h3>
<h3>JS, Matlab, Go, Haskell, Perl, Ruby</h3>
<p>
Minimal but existing experience with the above languages meaning I do know the syntax and have worked with them before but would consider myself in need of having to do a few weeks of studying before truly being comfortable of applying them to complex situations
</p>

<h1>Programming Related Things</h1>

<h3 style="float:right; position:relative; top:-1em">[<span style="color:#F33C72;">▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▯▯▯</span>]</h3>
<h3>Git</h3>
<p>
I'm aware of best-practice for version control and I'm fully capable of integrating into a projects infrastructure, rebasing, pull-request, etc.. I have no experience with Mercurial.
</p>

<h3 style="float:right; position:relative; top:-1em">[<span style="color:#F33C72;">▮▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯▯</span>]</h3>
<h3>CMake</h3>
<p>
I don't particularly enjoy cmake but have been using it for every C++ project out of necessity so far including for big projects and I'm confident I can spot whats causing cmake errors and setup a proper install script for my current project and similar tasks.
</p>

<h3 style="float:right; position:relative; top:-1em">[<span style="color:#F33C72;">▮▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯▯</span>]</h3>
<h3>Latex</h3>
<p>
I've exclusively used Latex for homework, assignments, papers and documentation in both my personal and professional life and while I do have to google things frequently I'm able to format any product according to template and styleguides.
</p>

<p>
<h3 style="float:right; position:relative; top:-1em">[<span style="color:#F33C72;">▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯▯▯</span>]</h3>
<h3>HTML, CSS</h3>
<p>
I obviously know enough to create this static website, I am able to read html code but I have very little experience with web-based interfaces such as WebGL and dynamic websites
</p>
