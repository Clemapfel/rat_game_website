## jluna: A Julia Wrapper for C++

Available [here](https://github.com/Clemapfel/jluna), under MIT License.

Comprehensive wrapper around the [Julia](https://julialang.org) C-API, includes automated memory-management, exception
safety, convenient linking. Allows for native C++ code interacting with the Julia state from within a thread, even 
though this  is currently impossible in the pure Julia C-API. Thread-safe, parallelized, fast, well-tested & stable.

Includes hand-written, step-by-step guide and documentation.

Feature-complete, version 0.9 will be upgraded to 1.0 in Winter 2022.

## CRISP: **R**eal-time **I**nteractive **S**ignal **P**rocessing Library

Available [here](https://github.com/Clemapfel/crisp), under MIT License.

A library demonstrating my expertise in image- and audio-processing techniques, written from scratch. Supports GPU-side
computation, 32bit HDR colors,  spectral techniques, automated segmentation, deep-learning based feature classification.
Verbose, hand-written documentation.

## Telescope: A 2D Game Engine

Available [here](https://github.com/Clemapfel/telescope), under GPLv3.

[Commissioned](https://github.com/jhigginbotham64), but mostly designed and implemented by me. Includes a simplified,
yet functionally equivalent wrapper around Box2D, opengl-based primitives, sound- and music-management. Comes with a
syntax-equivalent Julia binding, implemented using an internal C interface for interoperability.

Planned features: real-time audio processing, shaders-interface, 2d lighting engine

Provides tutorial and automatically generated documentation, written by me. The latter uses [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl) for inline documentation, 
translated to [rst](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) using [breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Styled and hosted with [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org).
