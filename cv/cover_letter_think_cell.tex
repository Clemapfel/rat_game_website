Dear Sir or Madam,
\emptyline

\emptyline
I am applying for the position of Staff Engineer (LI-DS1) at your Berlin Rheinstra{\ss}e site.\linebreak

Reviewing your application, I am not only excited to see that my skill set and work history fulfills all of your mandatory requirements, but that the position and the field of image/video-processing, in general, aligns strongly with my passions for visual computing.\linebreak
I not only have an excellent foundation in C++ and general software-design, but I also have an established background in (medical) image processing and real-time rendering, both of which gave me a deep familiarity with the science, math, and algorithmic design behind it. \linebreak

My medical background instilled into me the importance of assuring correctness at all times, and delivering a user-experience that is not only up to budget and specifications but guaranteed to always work exactly as intended.\linebreak
%Similarly, the fundamental paradigm of my years of experience in performance optimization in games development taught me that all the computation has to be assured to happen within one frame, any longer and the user experience will be severely impacted.
Similarly the fundamental paradigm of performance optimization in game development is to always make sure all computation happens within one frame, any longer and the user experience will be severely impacted.
This directly transfers to video-processing, and I am confident that because of this skill and my desire to always achieve the most fluid, well-optimized, and thus enjoyable user experience possible, I would be an ideal candidate for a team already aiming to provide this to potential clients.

As no relocation or similar life-change is necessary, I would be available at the earliest convenience.
Please, take a look at my attached CV to get a better and more detailed picture of me and my skill set.\linebreak

Please feel free to reach out to me via the contact data at the top of this letter or on my CV,

Kind regards,\newline
