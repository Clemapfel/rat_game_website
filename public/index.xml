- me, every morning I wake up jobless including today On this page I will talk about myself, what I do / did and what my professional qualifications are. References or certificates of proficiency can be provided on request. Please navgiate to the appropriate section with the following table of contents:
 General Information
 Education
 Programming Skills 3.1 Legend 3.2 Programming Languages 3.3 Programming Related Things  Natural Languages  Soft Skills &amp;amp; Expectation    General Information  Nationality: German, born in Berlin Age: 25 Location: Berlin, Germany (available to move after September 2021) Professional Interested: Statistics, Bleeding Edge Performance Optimization, Data Visualization, Big Data Processing Personal Interested: Gaming, Watercolor and Ink Wash Painting, Felt Sculptures, keeping Pet Birds  Education  Graduated Lilienthal Highschool, Berlin in 2011, 2011 - 2012 full-time student: 2 Semester of Bachelor of Pure Math at TU Berlin 2013 - 2016 full-time student: Switched to Bachelor Bioinformatics at FU Berlin

finished Bachelorthesis creating an optimized kmer-index for SeqAn3 2020 - present only part-time lead developer and artist for rat_game due to insufficient funding   Programming Skills Legend On this page my proficienency in a given language will be visually depicted on a scale from 0 to 10 with the aid of bar as such:
[▮▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯] : Novice
Syntax and paradigms as well as general features are known to me and I&amp;rsquo;m able to understand averagely complex code written by other people. I have setup this language on my computer before and know how to compile or run programs. I have not worked with this language for longer than a few hours
[▮▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯▯] : Intermediate I know how to write complex programs in this application and how to interpret common compiler errors. I know most notable features of the standard library and how to use them and I&amp;rsquo;ve used common external modules related to my field. I have worked with this language for multiple months
[▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮] : Expert : Expert I know this language very well, I can write code fluently without looking things up. I have experience with the inner workings of the language and am familiar with every standard library feature and all of the obscure idiosyncracies. Similarly I have seen every compiler error there is I am familiar with many 3rd party libraries related to my field. I have worked with this language for years. (Note that this is only a visual aid and as such there is no highly defined meaning to a score of for example 6/10 compared to 7/10.)
 Programming Languages  C&#43;&#43;[▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▯]
Over 3 years of experience including 1.5 years of using it daily as a full-time job on a big multi-person project. It&#39;s my language of choice and I consider myself highly familiar with it, including things like compile-time execution, bleeding edge performance optimization (which was the main focus of my thesis), meta template programming, and good-practice like const correctness at all times, not yet rolled out C&#43;&#43;20 features like ranges and concepts as well as many 3rd party libraries such as Boost, Abseil, Google Benchmark &amp; Test as well as Lua- and Xml Interfaces and of course SeqAn3  R[▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▯▯]
Over 2 years of experience. My language of choice for data processing and visualization. I have taught statistics Lectures as a TA using R and I gave special crashcourses for students in this language. Every bigger project that requires graphing or dealing with data I would do almost exclusively in R and I am confident of my visualization skills and using ggplot2 and other tidyverse modules to create expressive graphs, well substantiated results and neat and easy to read scripts to create them.  Lua[▮▮▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯]
I choose Lua as a secondary support language for [rat_games](../rat_game/landing) C&#43;&#43; engine and have thus worked with it for 1.5a as part of my daily tasks. I consider it a decent data-representation language and the interface between it and C&amp;#43;&amp;#43; is stellar and allows me to seamlessly pass complex object between each language. I know lua syntax and have used metatables or concurrent execution in the past, however I consider Lua a secondary language and wouldn&#39;t be confident creating a project that is solely done in lua quite yet.  Swift[▮▮▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯]
Objective-C[▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯▯▯]
During an internship scraping the server of a radiologists office I was tasked to exclusively develop for mac and as such became familiar with both objective-c and it&#39;s de-facto replacement swift in a professional context. While I consider myself capable of working on a large-scale objective-c project if I was to create my own from scratch I would vastly prefer swift which is one of my favorite languages but because of the non-portability I can rarely justify using it for science-related applications.  Python[▮▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯▯]
I mostly use python for (genomic-) text-processing as well as more complex single-run programs like scripts extracting values or anaylzing tables. I feel comfortable in python but do not consider myself fully able to match the skill and pythonic-ness of professionals with years of experience. We used python a lot at uni and for my own projects I&#39;ve for example written a complex AI for [rat_game](../rat_game/landing) in python.  GLSL[▮▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯▯]
While not very relevant in data science applications I have used GLSL in 2d environments to create complex shaders and through the restrictions inherent to the language I feel that I now have a good grasp on paralel execution in distributed system as each OpenGL fragment is basically a little node running the same GLSL script as all the others just like in a distributed system. I have some experience with the OpenGL system-interface functions but I consider myself only fully capable of employing it in 2d-only applications.  Java[▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯▯▯]
During lectures for my pure math degree we had to use java and I only ever used it in that context. If a task requires and object-oriented programming language I&#39;d much rather use C&#43;&#43; but I know enough Java to understand code written by others and to be able to modify / refactor it and to develop smaller modules for a bigger library. I&#39;d just prefer to do the same but in C&#43;&#43;.  JS[▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯▯▯]
I use javascript mostly to interfacing with data that happens to be provided in json and I like the language a lot. During website-related work I have dealt with it in a more encapsulated way and while I don&#39;t consider myself an expert out of all of the languages here I&#39;m most motivated to learn more about JS.  Bash[▮▮▮▯▯▯▯▯▯▯]
I know enough bash to write stuff to get my programm running or stitch programs together to create a pipeline or do system-admin stuff but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m able to create bigger bash-only projects without previous studying. I am confident though with using both MacOS and a Linux-distribution shell (in stark contrast to windows powershell which I prefer to... not deal with - ever).  MatLab[▮▮▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯]
We used MatLab (or Octav) in almost every math-related lecture and I&#39;m able to use it as a tool in that context, however I have not worked with it in a professional context other than as a helper for doing complex operations. I know the syntax and many of the highly useful features but if I want to do complex math I usually prefer to use R or Python modules  Go[▮▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯]
Haskell[▮▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯]
Perl[▮▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯]
Ruby[▮▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯]
Minimal experience but I have used these before and I wouldn not be starting at 0 learning any of these languages to use at full effect. I&#39;m actually excited to learn more about go as the few hours I&#39;ve played around with it show a lot of potential for me and I enjoy the design. Programming Related Things  Git[▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▯▯▯]
I&#39;ve been using git for years and am comfortable with all the day-to-day stuff like pull requests and rebasing and properly formatting commit messages. I&#39;ve worked in international multi-person projects all using the same github repo so I&#39;m aware of all the features however I don&#39;t think I would be able to set such a big server up myself without previously studying how to do it properly. In summary: I can use what&#39;s already there really well but if I have to make it be already there for others I&#39;d rather someone more qualified do that.  CMake[▮▮▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯]
I don&#39;t particularly enjoy cmake but have been using it for every C&#43;&#43; project after so far including for big libraries such as SeqAn3 so I&#39;m confident I can spot whats causing cmake errors and setup a proper install script for my current project.  Latex[▮▮▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯]
I&#39;ve been turning in my homework or thesis&#39; in latex since I started going to college so I am able to create well formatted and cohesive projects of arbitrary purposed requirement. I do often have to look up all the proper labels and codes though  HTML[▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯▯▯]
CSS[▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯▯▯]
I know enough to create this website by myself but I wouldn&#39;t consider myself a web-developer and would much rather be applied to the back-end and under-the-hood stuff servers-side.  MySQL[▮▮▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯]
We used MySQL all throughout our database lectures so I am familiar with it and know how to use it however I have not yet worked on a big multi-person project with MySQL especially none where the database is cosntantly changing, in bioinformatics they&#39;re often quite static but I realize that for commerce this is rarely the case.  Natural Languages  German[▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮]
I was born and educated in germany so I&#39;m fluent both in conversational and academic tone in any subject  English[▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮]
I had a lot of exposure to english friends and any professional or programming work including papers or reports will be written in english exclusively by me so I consider myself fluent and almost accent-free both conversationally and academically talking about any subject.  Japanese[▮▮▮▮▯▯▯▯▯▯]
I&#39;ve taken 2 years of weekly tutoring so I consider myself not a novice, I can hold conversations about simple topics but to translate more complex thigns especially written I will have to consult a dictionary.  Italian[▮▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯]
French[▮▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯]
4 Semesters in Highschool twice-weekly. I don&#39;t think I would survive if I was thrown into italy/france but I do know the basics of grammar, pronounciation, etc. and I think with a few months of tutoring I could become versed enough to handle day-to-day workplace situations like meetings or emails.  Soft-Skills and Expectations I consider myself team-oriented and am willing to delegate tasks or have tasks delegated to me if it&amp;rsquo;s the better option for the current project. My work tends to mean a lot to and I&amp;rsquo;m proud to do the best I can on anything that I enjoy doing which may sometimes backfire when a project fails because of reasons out of my control which may impact me emotionally. I prefer working later and on a flexible time schedule even late at night if those hours are needed but I do not have a problem with regular day-to-day work schedules. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any personal or familial restraints until about the end of 2021 after which I&amp;rsquo;m okay with moving to pretty much any city in the world if they job is worth it.
