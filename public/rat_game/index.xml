This page acts as a repository and index of all rat_game related content. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m lead artist and developer for rat_game (after funding cuts forced me to put my editor, animator and music licensees on hold). Nontheless I will work tirelessly until my vision is complete even if it takes years and I&amp;rsquo;m homeless afterwards I can at least say I tried my best.
Please navigate to the appropriate sections with the table of contents below Frequently Asked Questions
FAQ  Here are some frequently asked questions:  What is rat_game?  rat_game is a turn-based jRPG indie game where you control up to 4 characters to explore the world and fight others in a pokemon-like 4vN battle system. Heavy Inspiration was taken from: Super Mario RPG, Mother 3, Competitive irl Pokèmon Tournaments, my fucked up childhood and definitely not Undertale   What is rat_games story about? Here&#39;s the elevator pitch: &#34;rat_game is a game in a world where a hivemind has taken over every human being. Some humans are immune due to a specific gene and as such the hivemind has been hunting and exterminating them viciously. 6 Months into the end-times you wake up into a world that has been terraformed and heavily altered because now all humans work in perfect unison, nobody is hungry anymore and medicine and science have been doing leaps at light speed. During the plot various events guide you onto the path of finding the &#34;source&#34; of the hivemind and to defeat them to SAVE the entire w-&#34; I fucking hate elevator pitchs. Here&#39;s what rat_game is actually about: everytime a human is about to be taken over from their perspective reality warps into a kind of dream reality. If they die in that reality they brain is surrendered to the hivemind. While what&#39;s said above is what technically happens it&#39;s purpose is as a framing device for surreal dream sequences, half-reality half-memories as dreams are they mix and match almost at random element from the games reality, the games surreality and my (the authors) actual reality. Through these sequences I intend to deal with things from my characters&#39; life and also my own life in a metaphorical almost therapeuthic way. Because your actions in the &#34;dreamworld&#34; still matter they still have influence to the literal plot but the point of rat_game is not to save the world and win the game, it&#39;s intended as a framing device for playable metaphors and allegories of things that are very private and very important to me and to the characters. Hopefully that didn&#39;t sound too pretentious because you can also just ignore all that and play the game ingoring the scenery and just enjoying it mechanically fighting cool bosses. That style of play is not an afterthought.
  What is rat_games gameplay like?  I think &#34;turn-based jRPG&#34; battle system get a bad wrap. I&#39;m the first to say all the criticism are valid, you only press A and most games don&#39;t do anything with it. That&#39;s why I came from the complete other perspective: let&#39;s find the most complex and engaging turn-based battle system there is and distill that to it&#39;s purest most enjoyable single player form. For me this was Pokémon competitive battles. If you don&#39;t know people play Pokémon 2v2 in irl tournaments and they can win huge prizes, there&#39;s world cups and they fly all over the globe etc. This format &#34;VGC&#34; is completely different from regular pokemon, the strategies are vibrantly diverse and all the bs bad pokemon and underwhelming effects are discarded for the sake of being viable. I want my game to have that type of pool of enemies / abilities as the baseline. There is no fire move that will be useless in 8h because you got the same firemove but this time it does more damage. There is only 1 fire move and you should use it in combination with others if you need them. Apart from eliminating redundancy I also intend to eliminate randomness. I have an entire essay on this on my tumblr but for me, every action that impacts the player negatively has to be the result of a deterministic process. No random crits that kill you, no 10% freeze chance and if they get it you loose, etc.. The third point is strategy and build variety. In rat_game there&#39;s 4 (or maybe more?) characters you can play. Each have a few inherent abilities and stats but you can equip at least 10 different abilities to each character. All ablities can be equipped to all characters but you only have 1 of each. Abilties in rat_game have complex combos and interactions and without going too much into detail the point is to create a system that&#39;s easy to read, has a low amount of moving parts but is so complex and mentally taxing that that outweights the &#34;no-fun-factor&#34; of just having to press A through a menu instead of pointing the mouse on the terrorist and clicking. Here are some posts in which I explain this in more detail: TODO 
 Who made it? How long has it been in development? rat_game was conceived by me, maybe 6 years ago. Over about 3 years I just kinda thought about it and it collected more and more good ideas like a katamari to the point that 2.5a ago I started tinkering on the engine while in university. Then I happend to fall ill to the point where getting grades wasn&#39;t really possible so I took some time off to get better and because I couldn&#39;t really do much else I went all in on rat_game. So far I&#39;ve spend about 1800h of programming excluding art and ressources, I have an animator, an editor and a musician ready to work for me and the script (the equivalent of a movie script but for games) is 100% done in my head and about 60% of that is on paper already. While this all sounds amazing funding ran out november of 2020, I can&#39;t currently keep anyone employed and I&#39;m working part time on my stuff in my free time. Hopefully I either get some new funding or I&#39;ll get a good job and save up so I can take another 2 years of full-time and finish this.
  Why is it called that? It&#39;s a working title but, the problem with video game titles are that: a) they need to be unique and easily googlable. b) they need to be memorable and c) I need to feel l ike it represents my game well enough. Getting all of these 3 is hard, Ideally you&#39;ll get a data void which means there are no other results if you google that term but then you end up with titles like &#34;Zarashala: Reckoning of the Mgeth&#39;tir&#34; where it&#39;s not even real worlds anymore. Idk, I&#39;ll probably change it before the demo releaeses but maybe I&#39;m not able to and I&#39;ll be the next &#34;untitlted goose rat game&#34;
  When will it release? As discussed in the question above this one there is currently no way to finish it. I simply don&#39;t have enough money. My hopefully realistic plan is to work on everything in my free time to the point where the engine is done and I have a day-job, then during my free-time I can create all the assest and drawing and writing which isn&#39;t as taxing as proramming and after a year or so I hopefully have a demo I can show people. If the demo is done my hope is that I can proof to people that I&#39;m serious about this and that I can do it and that it will also be good so at that point when
  Can I participate? Yes! If you want to and also if I can use your work. Even in these early stages I have had people reach out to me and I always say that if I see a good idea I will take that and use it (properly crediting you of course) but don&#39;t expect to draw something for me and for me to put it in the game unaltered, it&#39;s important to me that the art direction is handtuned to perfection. You can also join the official rat_game discord here: TODO or you can reach out to me personally on twitter here: TODO. Even if I don&#39;t want your work it&#39;s always nice to know that someones else cares and I will never reject sincere excitement.
