      <content:encoded><![CDATA[  Abstract   Earthbound (1994, SNES) has been hugely influential on both niche indie games and large mainstream AAA successes. This article proposes that a lineage of games, inherently linked by the specific design decision and artistics ideas they share, form a new genre: &#34;earthbound-likes&#34;. As Earthbound, Yume Nikki, various commercial RPG-Maker games such as OFF and LISA, the Mario RPG series and lastly Undertale are examined, properties that went on to be inherited by their successors and thus became part of the lineage are identified and collected to form a definition, a checklist of what makes a game an &#34;earthbound-like&#34;. The exact nature of the definition is stated and argued to be specific enough to warrant to be considered it&#39;s own genre. This article aims to give future generations a way to appreciate these often somewhat niche games for what they contributed to the genres successes and what they will surely go on to contribute to many games to come.   Table of Contents  Motivation

 An actual Definition
 Footnotes   1 Motivation I want to start this piece on a personal note, I was casually talking to a friend and I opened the conversation by showing them the following screenshot of a &amp;ldquo;Omori&amp;rdquo; (which is by all accounts a very good game) completely out of context:
 Figure 1.0: Battle Scene from Omori that I showed to my friend.  I just thought it looks nice, right? Their reaction was a lot stronger than I anticipated: &amp;ldquo;Looks neat but man I just get the vibe it&amp;rsquo;s a generic western jRPG in a cool package&amp;rdquo;. I poked further and they went on to elaborate that they feel like it&amp;rsquo;s just another one of &amp;ldquo;those&amp;rdquo; games, midly disturbing subject matter, quirky world, shallow jRPG combat and an amazing visual presentation. I do not necessarily agree with any of these and obviously my friend hasn&amp;rsquo;t played the game so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even consider it their opinion, really, but even after the conversation went on I kept thinking about what they said. It implies that Omori is part of a lineage, that an out-of-context screenshot of it&amp;rsquo;s battle system is enough evidence to not only know what very specific type of game it is but to also judge it as so alike every other such game that it becomes generic.
In this piece I will not argue for or against Omori or talk about it much at all, I won&amp;rsquo;t yet disclose if I agree with my friend or if they changed their opinion after doing more research, rather I would like to examine what exactly my friend was intuitively comparing Omori to and how we got to that point.
1.1 Some Examples  Figure 1.1: The equivalent of a Battle in Dujanah. (source: Rock, Paper, Shotgun)  As you may have guessed from the title, I will call the genre I think Omori is part of &amp;ldquo;earthbound-likes&amp;rdquo;. I think most will be familiar with the term &amp;ldquo;souls-like&amp;rdquo; which does have a set of fairly clearly formulated properties [1] but for the sake of argument I will give a single line definition: &amp;ldquo;A souls-like game is a game that was inspired by Dark Souls&amp;rdquo;. An earthbound-like, then, is a game inspired by Mother 2: Earthbound. Though much like with souls-likes, it goes far deeper than that. As I will aim to illustrate, earthbound-likes follow a clear timeline of sorts, as another game joined their lineage it based it&amp;rsquo;s ideas on those that game before it and over time, the genre and the set of ideas of all the games contained in it grew. Similarly to how souls-like incorporated ideas from Bloodborn or how metroidvania incorporated ideas not only from Super Metroid but the PS1 and GBA Castlevania titles. While all of these started with one game, today the genres identity can be traced to far more than just it&amp;rsquo;s originator.
For now here is a non-exhaustive, non-ordered list of games I consider earthbound-likes:
  The Mother Series (Mother 1, Mother 2: Earthbound, Mother 3)
  Mario RPG (SNES), Paper Mario 64, Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, Mario &amp;amp; Luigi: Super Star Saga, Mario &amp;amp; Luigi: Bowsers Inside Story, Marioa &amp;amp; Luigi: Partners in Time, etc.
  Most if not all of the commercially released RPG-Maker games, including but not limited to:
  Yume-Nikki,  Yume 2kki,  LISA: The Painful,  To the Moon,  OFF,  One Shot,  Escaped Chasms,  .flow,  Ib,  Dreaming Mary,  Suits: A Business RPG  The Witch&amp;#39;s House,  Jimmy &amp;amp; The Pulsating Mass,  Dujanah,  Hylics     Undertale and it&amp;#39;s sequels
   (Note: please visit any of these links in order to buy and/or download any game mentioned here. I whole-heartedly recommend them all and some of them are free!) 
I think most people that are familiar with these games can already form a somewhat clear picture of what I mean when I say earthbound-like but let&amp;rsquo;s build my definition step by step, with the first step being, of course:
2 Earthbound Earthbound is the Dark-Souls of ... When Earthbound released it tanked in sales, became relatively obscure almost immediately and didn&#39;t even get a PAL import because Nintendo didn&#39;t want to bother. To this day Mother 3 (which is objectively a great game and whos Protagonist is in Smash Bros) still has not received official localization, that&#39;s how traumatic Earthbounds lack of success was to them. Many blamed this on the stink-based advertising but I personally believe it was mostly due to the fact that the game was non-optionally bundled with a strategy guide, raising the price above what similar games would&#39;ve costed off the same shelf. Most children in 1994 weren&#39;t willing to take a risk and spend their entires years gaming-budget on a game actively marketed as super weird and unlike any other game they knew.
That last point is not technically true however, Earthbound was very much alike it&#39;s prequel: Mother 1 for the NES (later released as Earthbound Beginnings on the Nintendo Eshop. I don&#39;t want to dwell to deep on Earthbound history and Mother 1, there are entire websites dedicated to it and this piece will already be long enough as it is but what I do want to note is that Earthbound wasn&#39;t iconic when it came out, no, it took some time to become iconic. I personally played the game for the first time in 2014 on an emulator, however I (probably becuase of being based in europe) was relatively late to the party. Most people who would eventually get really into Earthbound played it around the start of the 2000s.  Figure 2.0: Saturn Valley in Mother 1. (source: Earthboundcentral)  So what made Earthbound special? It was a good game but I think what made it stand out is how unlike traditional jRPGs [2] it really was. It was set in a facsimile of suburban america, you had to actually put your money into an ATM, enemies were rabid dogs, angry ducks, homeless people but then there were also three psychicly connected moles, full-sized dinosaurs, a guy that lives inside a dungeon and the dungeon is also a statue that walks around, you get the idea. It&amp;rsquo;s story was almost nonsensical, an episodic fever dream of walking around an increasingly surreal world erasing pencil-shaped roadblocks made out of metal and waiting behind a waterfall for 1h in real time to fight a literal pile of vomit. Earthbound was odd, quirky and - unlike it&amp;rsquo;s advertising - incredibly charming. Pairing that with decent graphics, sound and controls even by todays standards and one of the best soundtracks in all of gaming and you get a cult classic. However while all of these things are important they only make up half of Earthbound gameplay.
2.1 Earthbounds Combat  Figure 2.1: Battle against a Moonside &#34;Crazed [Street] Sign&#34; in Earthbound.  Like all traditional jRPGs gameplay in Earthbound exists in one of two states: in the &amp;ldquo;overworld&amp;rdquo; you walk around talking to people, maybe solving some light puzzles. There you can walk into (or otherwise interact with) an enemy (who may or may not be also trying to interact with you) to start a&amp;hellip; let&amp;rsquo;s say &amp;ldquo;abstract representation&amp;rdquo; of a battle. Instead of having a sense of place Earthbound simply has static sprites floating in front of a 1994 SNES SFX-Chip-facilitated shader fever dream. Pairing this with the weird and unique enemy designs (c.f. Fig. 2.1 above) made for an extremely unusally looking battle system. What took place underneath that asthetic however was very much like a traditional jRPG; one might maybe even call it generic. People usually don&amp;rsquo;t feel that way when thinking about their memories with Earthbound though. This is for multiple reason: firstly the fact you&amp;rsquo;re fighting all these crazy creatures really does inherently bring a lot of flavor and memorability into battles. Along the Pokémon-esque rock-paper-scissor weakness-means-more-damage system Earthbound also includes a lot (and I mean &amp;ldquo;a lot&amp;rdquo; as in &amp;ldquo;too many&amp;rdquo;) esoteric status ailments in a somewhat vain effort to add complexity. While there&amp;rsquo;s traditional statuses like being asleep, poisoned and burning there&amp;rsquo;s also: having fleas, having a runny nose, feeling homesick, having a mushroom grow on you, feeling &amp;ldquo;strange&amp;rdquo;, having a sunstroke. The actual mechanical purpose of these is fairly opaque and I think most player could not name the actual gameplay impact most of these have but that didn&amp;rsquo;t really matter, much like the choice of setting and enemies the quirky statuses added flavor rather than depth - which isn&amp;rsquo;t a bad thing. It is fun to play a game on your SNES and find out mid-battle that your character can have a runny nose and miss a turn because they&amp;rsquo;re sniffling and if for no other reason than this, all the statuses were worth the inclusion in my opinion.
 Figure 2.1.1: Animated .gif showing the rolling health meter. (source: lparchive)  Another often remembered feature is the &amp;ldquo;rolling&amp;rdquo; health bar (c.f. Fig. 2.1.1). When loosing or gaining health, rather than instantly adding the given amount to the party-members healthbar it instead adds to it slowly and in real time. &amp;ldquo;Real time&amp;rdquo; meaning that while you menu or wait for attack animations to play out the health slowly &amp;ldquo;rolls&amp;rdquo; up or down. The intended emergent gameplay moment of this is for you take a huge hit that would ordinarily instantly kill your character and instead having the health roll down at rate that now incentivizes fast action, if you&amp;rsquo;re quick enough (and you get lucky enough that the other animations aren&amp;rsquo;t too long) you may be able to select a healing item at which point your health immediately starts rolling up instead, avoiding death. I think most player will have at least one moment like this and for that alone this system was worth the inclusion but I also think that much like the numerous weird status ailments it only provides the illusion of depth. If you were to replace the system with the traditional die-instantly way of taking damage you would would only need to redesign a single-digit number of encounters[3] over an entire playthrough and everything else would go the exact same way mechanically. All that really changes is the potential emotional impact. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to critique this system too much, I think it is a good system but much like the status ailments it&amp;rsquo;s inclusion did not result in adding significant depth, rather it added flavor. I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to recognize this and (spoiler alert) it will be a fundamental principle in games that followed in Earthbound footsteps.
2.2 Giygas  Figure 2.2: Animated .gif showing the background texture and shader during the battle against Giygas. Note the vague shape of a fetus with a brain and umbilical cord in the pattern.  Giygas is the penultimate villain and final boss of Earthbound and it&amp;rsquo;s honestly hard to describe what it even is in-lore. It&amp;rsquo;s an abstract, non-corporeal personification of evilness in general. You get to the final fight by first traveling into the future where all life on earth and even the atmosphere is completely destroyed, you enter a womb-like structure and when fighting against it it&amp;rsquo;s the first thing you notice is that unlike any other enemy in Earthbound is not just a static sprite in front of a shader background (except for pokey at during the first phase). Rather the shader background is the Giygas resulting in it feeling ethereal and omnipresent. Shigesato Itoi, Earthbounds designer, credited the experience of walking into the wrong cinema and seeing a very violent scene as a young child as inspiration for Giygas presentation and I think it is one of the most memorable villains in all of gaming, not because of writing or mechanics but because of it&amp;rsquo;s position and the tone of the encounter relative to the game it resides in. Up until this fight Earthbound was really light-hearted, there were some midly disturbing concepts like being in a cult and zombies but at five-seconds-before-midnight hour of the plot Earthbound goes from Pokémon Villains level of disturbing to full Lovecraft out of nowhere. I personally think that this and only this is why it Giygas had such an impact. The things that make Earthbound special and memorable aren&amp;rsquo;t inherent to it&amp;rsquo;s actual properties, rather it&amp;rsquo;s those properties in relation to the established norms of traditional jRPGs, of kids games in general and even of Earthbounds own plots tone. Earthbound is a traditional jRPG in every way except in affect, it tries very hard to be unlike them and for most people it succeeds. Rather than adding to the gameplay in a mechanically meaningful way it adds flavor, so much flavor in fact that instead of seeming try-hard it blew past that and ascended to cult status.
I may have been coming off as negative so far but I do want to explicitely state here that Earthbounds is an amazing game, amazing despite it&amp;rsquo;s gameplay and frankly that gameplay barely matters if all other parts are this compelling and unique.
&amp;hellip; that is until it wasn&amp;rsquo;t unique anymore like 10 years later.
 Let&amp;rsquo;s quickly take inventory of some of Earthbounds properties. Trust me, I&amp;rsquo;m going somewhere with this:
 quirky and light-hearted world
 surreal, character-introduction-driven plot (each chapter corresponds to one party member)
 very literal plot (there are no big themes or metaphors tackled and everything that happens happens diagetically)
 shallow jRPG battle system with great presentation
 mechanics are added for flavor, not for depth
 plot suddenly shifts to very dark subject matter during the final moments
  3 RPG-Maker   Figure 3: UI for creating a battle in the first english version of RPG-Maker. (source: steam)  So you really liked Earthbound and you want to make your own Earthbound, what do you do? Well you could get a degree in computer sciencr and learn to program and spend 3 years in your bedroom creating a game from scratch or you could just take Earthbound and&amp;hellip; make it yours by modifying the actual game for the SNES with hacking tools. This is called romhacking and I only want to mention Earthbounds romhacking scene because of one very important actor that will have their start here, nevertheless even in 2000 people wanted to make their own Earthbound and while they didn&amp;rsquo;t technically need to be able to code it was still kinda hard for the non tech-literate.
That was until in late 2000 RPG-Maker was created. Intended as 45% Engine, 45% development tool, 10% publishing platform, RPG-Maker boiled traditional jRPGs down to their purest form. It was literally designed to be the tropiest of jRPGs, turn-based combat, high-fantasy setting, tile-based movement, 2d-sprites, the works. It was also designed to be incredibly easy to use, much like what Flash did for animators, with RPG-Maker every person with a small amount of determination and even smaller amount of money can create their own game. These games were inherently limited though. Modifying the RPG-Maker engine is hard, not only do the Terms of Service not really like that you try but it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t give the tools and absolute freedom some games need. For example (and this is specific mostly for earlier versions of the engine) games had to run in a tiny window at native resolution, the engine was terribly optimized, displaying fonts broke constantly, features were slowly getting rolled out with limited backwards-compatibility, that is to say it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a very good game engine back then (I heard it&amp;rsquo;s pretty decent nowadays though) but what it was very good at was giving players who were really into Earthbound but not at all into computer science a tool to make their own. And so they did.
3.1 Yume Nikki  Figure 3.1: KyūKyū-kun, a non-interactable NPC in Yume Nikki who rubs a staricase, emitting a scrubbing noise similar to plastic gloves on glass. (source: giantbomb)  Yume Nikki was released by the highly enigmatic &amp;ldquo;Kikiyama&amp;rdquo;, the games name in japanese translates to &amp;ldquo;dream diaries&amp;rdquo; and fitting of it&amp;rsquo;s title it&amp;rsquo;s incomprehensible yet incredibly emotionally affecting. It was made with a very old version of RPG-Maker and I can&amp;rsquo;t help but think that that is why Yume Nikki chose to completely forgo one of the defining features of jRPGs: turn-based combat. Yume Nikki is a jRPG that&amp;rsquo;s all overworld. There is no strategic gameplay and the game consists of just kinda walking around, looking at things. Today some would call Yume Nikki a walking simulator, you do explore a set of vast worlds but I&amp;rsquo;d as the term &amp;ldquo;walking simulator&amp;rdquo; has some connotations I&amp;rsquo;d rather call Yume Nikki an RPG-Maker powered interactive art piece, mostly focused on illustrations and athmospheric music.
It has multiple worlds to explore, visually distinct from each other but very same-y within themself owing to RPG-Makers tile-based maps. What limited Interaction with the environment there is happens through &amp;ldquo;costumes&amp;rdquo;, collectable items you can pick up and equip that may just change the sprite of the player character or may interact with other objects like for example brandishing a knife to attack certain enemies. Others have done great work describing this game and what is appealing about it far better than I ever could so instead I would like to focus on a few very specific thing about it. In Yume Nikki you play as a girl that is implied to be a Hikikomori, a young adult that basically refuses to leave their room instead exclusively engaging in solitude and media. In-game you start in this room and to access the different worlds you use the titular dream journal. This way of accessing the actual games worlds frames them as inherently dream-like and thus explicitly a product of the main characters psyche. For example in one world you can see a car crash victims body lying on the street bleeding out and while there is neither dialogue nor much in the way of interaction the framing of the game cements this imagery as a representation of trauma of the main character. As Madotsuki (that&amp;rsquo;s her name) is basically a blank slate and the project feels so much like outsider-art made by one person far away in japan it is reasonable to see people project that trauma onto the dev themself. The car crash scene moves the goalpost in a way where now every single element of the mostly non-sensical world can possibly be interpreted as a metaphor and projected onto the main character like this.
I think that this. along with the trance-like experience of walking around surreal, beautiful but highly repeptitious worlds with athmospheric music and no goal or purpose other than to see more is why this game is has such an impact on people. There is a giant, very passionate fan-community around this game both in Japan and the US. I genuinely cannot overemphasize how huge this game is in certain circles, every character in the game even if they literally have no purpose other than being a visual element has their own lore and fandom. Most notably is the almost main-stream famous Uboa (c.f. Fig. 3.1.1 below), but no matter how purposeless the visual elements are to the gameplay, they all become functionally equivalent in the audiences mind because all of them become a piece of expressionism, seemingly aiding in the exploration of Madotsukis mind.
Yume Nikki is a very strange game, it has no relation to traditional jRPGs other than those inherited by RPG-Maker but by being so strange yet endearing it has itself become an influence on a whole new generation of indie-devs. Maybe it is because of the RPG-Maker community being a breeding ground for indie devs but over the years most games inspired by Earthbound were made by people who were also in turn inspired by Yume Nikki and I think seeing this game as the Castlevania of Metroidvanias, the Bloodborne of Souls-like, one of the ur-members of the earthbound-like lineage sheds light on not only it&amp;rsquo;s influence but on what made the game so interesting even in 2003.
 Figure 3.1.1: There is a very low chance that operating the light switch in this house in Yume Nikki leads to a non-interactable, jump-scare-like encounter with Uboa. [4]   Similar to the chapter on Earthbound I would like to take inventory of Yume Nikkis properties:
 surreal world that is a metaphorical exploration of the main character damaged psyche
 made in RPG-Maker by a single person overseas
 no mechanical or strategic challenge
  Let&amp;rsquo;s look at another early-gen RPG-Maker game made by an anonymous developer in a non-english speaking country:
3.2 OFF OFF may be a bad game. OFF is also an important game. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually want to judge the games quality but unlike Yume Nikki I don&amp;rsquo;t consider it a pillar of the genre, rather I would like to use OFF as a case-study to stand in for many, many other RPG-Maker games that are in the same vein. I&amp;rsquo;d like to show you two screenshots from OFF, hopefully without context. Try to only look at the first, read the paragraph below it and then look at the second
 Figure 3.2: OFFs overworld  I think most would recognize that this is a RPG-Maker game. It&amp;rsquo;s very basic, just solid colors and an overworld sprite so bland you could be forgiven if you think it&amp;rsquo;s as a placeholder. Movement feels terrible, the puzzles are terrible, the dialogue is horrendously translated and it runs in a tiny 400px x 300px window that cannot be maximized. Now let me show you the second glimpse of the game:
 
Figure 3.2.1: Timestamped video of the battle against one of the chapter bosses in OFF.
It&#39;s enough to watched ~25s of the video, note the music and arstyle of the enemy sprites. (source: Kairin on youtube)   Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know how long you&amp;rsquo;ve kept watching but hopefully you experience at least some of the spark this game emits. It&amp;rsquo;s still rough, the sprites for the party are literally just circles and a pixelated .png, it&amp;rsquo;s still a vanilla RPG-Maker game with terrible balancing and very little in terms of strategy but despite all of this it looks and sounds completely unique. The hand-drawn (some may call it doodled) look was achieved by literally drawing the sprites on paper and scanning the pages, down-res them and put them in the game without further work. Now this might not be totally true but what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make note of here is that the games graphic do give you that feeling. Once you&amp;rsquo;re confronted with realizing this it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite of immersize, instead the process of creating the game was made obvious and is instantly recognizable. If you actually play the game you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that not just the battles do this, cutscenes will have scanned-in prints from old real-world library books, the dialogue reads like someone with a decent knowledge of french and a&amp;hellip; suboptimal knowledge of english spend 2 evenings google-translating all the files in the RPG-Maker repo but none of that matters for the actual emotional experience of the game. It&amp;rsquo;s process over product, form over meaning and much like Yume Nikki or many contemporary art installations it confronts the audience directly with who made it and how they did it. In OFFs case one might say a bored french musician who just needed an outlet and in Yume Nikkis case opinions vary from a traumatized japanese hikikomori who wanted to translate their dispair into a game to just a talented artists with a strong sense of how to do expressionism well but what is the truth in both of these cases is that the game becomes an examination of the person who created it. RPG-Maker games are rarely made by studios, they&amp;rsquo;re rarely made by experienced devs, most often they are made by a single person with no budget and no coding experience who wanted to make something important enough for them to pour hundreds of hours of effort into creating it and I think if you peak behind the curtain even slightly, most every RPG-Maker game regardless of quality carries this connotation.
Let&amp;rsquo;s do our inventory for OFF:
 surreal world that is used as a framework to exhibit the developers visual and musical art
 made in RPG-Maker by a single person overseas
 no mechanical or strategic challenge
  4 Super Mario RPG, Super Star Saga and Paper Mario 64 Taking a break from no-budget indie games I&amp;rsquo;d like to circle back to a first-party game that had all the funding in the world and (unlike Earthbound) matching success. In 1996 Nintendo joined forces with the at that point incredibly critically acclaimed square who was just fresh of Final Fantasy 6 (SNES), one of the best jRPG of all time, to use the lovable plumber known for jumping when you press A in a&amp;hellip;turn-based jRPG? I think the devs were well aware of the discrepancy inherent in that concept and proceeded to solve the issue with a fresh and ingenious idea that went on to carry an entire franchise worth of sequels to this day.
 Figure 4.0: A basic battle against a flying koopa enemy in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars (SNES). Note that in order to execute the shell kick at maximum damage the player has to time the A press with the animation of the shell hitting the floor in front of mario.  They created in my opinion one of the best mechanics ever implemented in a turn-based rpg: action commands. Instead of just menu&amp;rsquo;ing and hitting A to select a move you have to also time an additional A-press in what may be described as a quick time event (QTE) nowadays. In Super Mario RPG (SNES) said QTE was communicated purely through animation, there&amp;rsquo;s no &amp;ldquo;hit A now&amp;rdquo; prompt, instead you have to time the press based on what&amp;rsquo;s happening on screen. This system is fuzzy, much like a rhythm game the closer to perfect you do the input the more damage the move will do. As the game went on, action commands got more and more complex, from simply pressing A once when attacking or defending to pressing A frame-perfectly 100 times in order to execute the highest damaging combo which is used by speed runners to obliterate every boss in no time. Later games in the series would incorporate more than just one button and with better technology better animations were made to accompany them. I would like to quickly distinguish between traditional QTEs (as seen in Resident Evil 4 for example) and action commands. In my opinion it comes down to this: a) does failing the button press result in a fail-state and b) does perfectly executing the command result in an additional effect on top of the default outcome. In RE4 if you don&amp;rsquo;t press the button fast enough you get eaten by the big fish and have to reload a save, hitting it perfectly is the default state, you don&amp;rsquo;t get any additional effect, it&amp;rsquo;s simply a challenge to overcome so the game can continue. In action games like Bayonetta, failing the QTE will result in a fail-state however doing the QTE well (for example hitting a button really fast) will not only let you continue with the game but get a bonus reward of extra currency or points. In the Mario RPG series failing the QTE does not result in a fail-state, for some moves it does not result in any punishment compared to the default of not doing anything like it was Final Fantasy at all. You can play Mother 3 without ever hitting a single QTE and it&amp;rsquo;ll play just like Earthbound but if you do hit that games rhythm based action command your attack will deal extra damage. That is the difference: failing a traditional QTE results in a fail-state, winning continues the game. Failing an action command doesn&amp;rsquo;t do anything, completing it result in a bonus. This classification is on a spectrum with RE4 on the other end and something like bayonetta square in the middle. Either way, the point of action commands was to replicate another more mainstream genres gameplay during a game state that originally did not have any gameplay whatsoever (like during a cutscene or while watching your attack animation play out) and even in 1996 it succeeds at that, replicating what is very similar to timing a jump in a traditional Mario game.
 Figure 4.1: Action command in Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga (GBA) (spanish localization pictured here). At higher difficulties the explicit button prompts will disappear and the player is tasked to memorize when to press A or B for maximum damage.  I often talk with people about jRPGs who have never liked them and their main reason for doing so is that they want &amp;ldquo;actual gameplay instead of just pressing A on a menu&amp;rdquo;. While the validity of this claim is questionable I think what is meant by this is that traditional jRPGs do not offer mechanical challenge like many of the other most profitable genres in gaming. Action games, fps, platformers, even casual mobile games like angry birds are by their very core about tasking the player with completing a mechanical challenge first and foremost. Games about strategy and simulation tend to be more niche and I think herein lies the problem, it&amp;rsquo;s not that many traditional jRPGs lack mechanical challenge, it&amp;rsquo;s that that mechanical challenge is rarely (especially in earthbound-likes) substituted with strategic gameplay. Few would call a Paradox a game about clicking on menus because it offers strategic and intellectual depth instead. Earthbound-likes - at least those we&amp;rsquo;ve looked at here so far - do not offer strategic depth. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t make them bad games, it just means it leaves their mass-market appeal below those of more traditional games. That is until Mario RPG and later (and probably most succesfully) Paper Mario 64 presented the same earthbound-like package except this time fights stimulate your hands as well. It worked, big-time, I know many people who would never finish an RPG-Maker game or even call themself interested in RPGs but who love Paper Mario to death and unlike Earthbound, Nintendo to this day keeps some of their first party studios busy developing Mario RPG games for their consoles.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think that &amp;ldquo;Final Fantasy but with mario and QTEs&amp;rdquo; fully represents the true appeal of the Mario RPG series. Unlike most other Nintendo properties the writers of the games and especially Super Mario RPG and Super Star Saga were given complete freedom. Both games do share enemies and elements with other Mario Games but they might as well take place in a paralell dimension, completely new art styles, original characters, powers, universes (super star saga&amp;rsquo;s world is based on beans instead of mushrooms). Instead of the personality-less version of their platformer-self, characters like Bowser or Mario himself are fleshed out so much it&amp;rsquo;s fair to call them wholly original with a light Mario paint-job.
 Figure 4.2: Battle against Culex, a hidden boss battle in Super Mario RPG (SNES) that vastly differs in visual presentation and difficulty from the base game and any Mario game.  What I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say is that the Mario RPG series aren&amp;rsquo;t really like other Mario games, instead they are alike arthbound-likes: A surreal yet quirky setting and visual design, biting wit and meta-commentary on the genre of jRPGs, the works. Mario &amp;amp; Luigi: Super Star Saga even has the sudden unexpectedly disturbing final boss fight (c.f. Figure 4.3 below). I can&amp;rsquo;t say if the devs were directly inspired by Earthbound but what I can state with confidence is that future earthbound-likes were very much inspired by the Mario RPG series. Suddenly, non-strategic jRPG combat felt less tolerable, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to make it complicated but you do have to make it unique or at least mechanically &amp;ldquo;more&amp;rdquo; than just pressing A in a menu. Not all games used the same system as Mario RPG, they may insert a rhythm mini game, a shmup or platformer, a fighting game, a dating sim, anything really. What genre to pull gameplay from is truly arbitrary and I think the wide variety of what devs would translate Mario RPGs action commands into shows how earthbound-like combat isn&amp;rsquo;t able to stand on it&amp;rsquo;s own in a post-Mario RPG world.
I want to explicitely state again: jRPG combat doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be hard or complex, games don&amp;rsquo;t have to have good combat to be good games at all. I want to instead just neutrally remark that adding mechanically interesting gameplay on top of the quintessential and thus generic jRPG gameplay without modifying that base is a very common trait for earthbound-likes. That is what Mario RPG went on to bring to the lineage, action commands are genius and it turns out they do especially well at making vanilla jRPG combat more exciting and appealing which happened to be exactly what Earthbound-likes needed to get big.
 Figure 4.3: Mario &amp; Luigi: Super Star Sagas (GBA) last boss. During this attack animation the player has to time the A and B presses independently to make Mario and Luigi jump respectively.  Instead of listing multiple things for this chapters inventory I&amp;rsquo;d instead just like to note a single property of the Mario RPG Series again: The battle system was made interesting not through strategic or conceptual complexity but through insertion of out-of-genre, mechanically interesting gameplay.
5 LISA (Content warning: pixelart depictions of body horror and gore, descriptions of sexual violence and domestic abuse towards children. Skip to here to avoid them)
LISA: The Painful (2014) is another RPG-Maker game, it was made in RPG Make VX Ace which unlike the version Yume Nikki and OFF were made in does offer developers a lot more freedom. LISA breaks with the trend of top-down 45° angle graphics and instead migrates to a 2D side-view, also including light platforming elements along with it. Just like Mario RPG, LISA also slotted another genre into battles: this time more akin to fighting game combos or maybe comparing it to DDR would be more correct. Instead of selecting moves from a menu you enter button combinations and depending on which permutation was inputted, the character will do a certain special attack.
 Figure 5.0 : The player inputs a series of button presses to trigger a special attack &#34;dropkick&#34; and deal additional damage in LISA: The Painful (PC). (source: comic vine)  While at first glance both the platforming and combo system make LISA a fairly unique RPG-Maker game I don&amp;rsquo;t actually want to bring LISA up just because of this. What makes LISA unique, especially in 2014, was the subject matter and how dark LISA was truly willing to be. Without going into story details, LISA has explicit scene of the Protagonist torturing or murdering someone, of being gunned down and riddled with arrows, slowly and agonizingly bleeding out. Enemy factions commiting essentially genocide and through out the game there are flashbacks to the protagonists live which shows (not alludes to) domestic abuse towards a child that was never loved and ravagely beaten by their friends and family, you get the idea. LISA is dark, I don&amp;rsquo;t consider LISA a very profound game, it explicitely contrasts these dark themes with levity and jokes about someone pooping in the open on a spider and homoerotic barbers construction a middle finger out of their combined hair but underneath all the edgyness is a core that many players will find emotionally exposing and very real.
 Figure 5.1 : &#34;Joy Mutant&#34; throne for the Trumpeter exhibiting Akira-esque body horror.  Like OFF, Lisa was made by essentially one person, also like OFF not very much is known about them. They intentionally used fictional characters from the game to release their music and to my knowledge their real name isn&amp;rsquo;t known, yet the sincerity and realism of how domestic abuse was portrayed in LISA let many people form a parasocial relationship with the main character and maybe even the perceived identity of the dev. I&amp;rsquo;d like to clarify here that I am not saying that either the dev or someone close to them has experienced domestic abuse or any of the atrocities in LISA, rather I&amp;rsquo;m pointing out that through death of the author the devs persona, the entity that seemingly made a game about all these intensely personal things, will have some audience members project those experience onto them just like in Yume Nikki. Yume Nikki dealt with loneliness and to some extend trauma but LISA not only went more towards the trauma side but showed it in explicit, disturbing detail.
As we&amp;rsquo;ve gone through the other games so far every game had a design decision or idea that went on to be inherited. LISA does have many original design decision but what I think LISA contributed most importantly is taking the lid of the how dark you&amp;rsquo;re allowed to go. Giygas was dark for what Earthbound was game but does not come close to themes tackled in LISA. LISA took away the stigma of RPG-Maker games having to imitate Earthbound in a way where most of it is quirky, light and child-friendly. LISA proved commercially and politically that you can do pretty much whatever you want but I do want to note that LISA isn&amp;rsquo;t tasteless, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t depict graphic rape scenes or realistic gore but for what is achievable in RPG-Maker, LISA went farther than any big successfull earthbound-like has gone to up to that point.
  Figure 5.2 : Scene from LISA: The Joyful (2015) showing a mutant cradling a child with the desecrated and deformed corpses of two seminal characters nearby   Much like LISA does itself I&#39;d like to insert somewhat arbitrarily placed levity here by noting that LISA: The Painful has a hidden area in which there is a school of fish with tiny feet living on land. One of the fish is a lawyer who you recruit and if you use his special attacks in battle he damages the enemy with paper cuts and the force of the justice system.   Just as before I&amp;rsquo;d like to take inventory of LISA properties before we continue:
 profoundly dark and disturbing subject matter that is thematically motivated by the main characters psyche
 quirky and sometimes funny plot
 little strategic challenge
 inserts an out-of-genre system to make battle more mechanically interesting
 made in RPG-Maker by a single person
  6 And then came many others With dev-tools improving and earthbound-likes finding widespread indie success, RPG-Maker games went from being an underground thing for devs who didn&amp;rsquo;t feel up to creating their game from scratch to a valid engine, delivery tool and genre. As a result many such games followed suit, from simple made-by-one-teenager games that don&amp;rsquo;t really have anything good to offer but still had enough love and effort poured into them to have been worth the time and purchase to multi-person teams with tens of thousands worth of budget and capital to be spend on artists and writers. RPG-Maker stopped being exclusively for amateurs and much like Yume Nikki all this time ago many games wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really be classified by many of their fans as traditional jRPGs at all.
Titles like To the Moon are more of a 2D interactive story than an RPG, yet it saw mainstream success and is regarded as one of the most emotionally impactful games from that decade. Here&amp;rsquo;s a non-ordered list with a quick blurb to highlight many of the games that came out during this period:
i) Oneshot: a RPG-Maker game where you can only die once, the game locks up afterwards so you really do only have &amp;ldquo;one shot&amp;rdquo; ii) Yume 2kki, an official sequel sanctioned by the original dev iii) Mother4, a direct sequel to Mother3 made by a team of talented non-nintendo devs. Sadly while nintendo refuses to support the mother series they do still seize and desist anything that tries to do it for them (#freemelee) so the project was canceled and is currently transitioning to become it&amp;rsquo;s own IP iv)&amp;ldquo;The Witches House&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Mad Father&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Angels of Death&amp;rdquo;, three game whos devs are to my knowledge completely unrelated yet all had the same idea of bringing a resident evil style pure horror game into the earthbound-like RPG-Maker format
Lastly &amp;ldquo;Omori&amp;rdquo; - despite my friends initial opinion of it earned - 200 000$ on kickstarter and was not only delivired to critically acclaim but is now being ported to non-PC consoles. It is by all measures a huge success. By todays poinbt in time earthbound-likes have seized to be niche whatsoever, they are a full industry and a pillar of gaming and for every obscure bland direct Earthbound copy there is a wholely original (if strongly inspired) game that enriched many peoples lifes. One title however stands far above them all though, so ubiquitously succesfull that many see it as the culmination and potential implosion of the earthbound-like genre.
7 Undertale Arguably one of the most influential indie games of all time and the supposed rags-to-riches story of one guy (along with his artist) making a game he cared about in his bedroom and selling over a million copies, Undertales reputation precedes it. As mentioned earlier in this piece the Developer of Undertale did not, in fact, came out of nowhere, he found his footing in the Earthbound romhack community and amassed a sizable audience there. That audience led him to try to get the snowball rolling on kickstarter and as lightning in a bottle it grew into an mixed-metaphor avalanche. Undertale is one of those things that by itself is so small but grew so big that fans had to extract every tiny element from it, every single character of even the lowest significance has a sub-fandom around them, the game blew up in the 2016 tumblr-scene so much that when Night in the Woods released I saw countless of reviews saying &#34;play this before the fandom ruins it like Undertale&#34;. I don&#39;t share the opinion that the reaction to Undertale in anyway colored the game and I&#39;m not really here to examine that. I&#39;m in a very priviledged position: I played Undertale completely out of context. I bought it the day it came out because it was on sale and I literally read no reviews or checked the internet before I finished it. It wasn&#39;t even intentional I just thought it&#39;s another obscure RPG-Maker (it was actually made in game maker) title that a few thousand people will play and as demonstrated in this piece I kinda like those games. So what was Undertale: the game, not Undertale: the phenomenon? Undertale is the quintessential earthbound-like, it&amp;rsquo;s creator literally went directly from working on Earthbound to working on it and the influence is obvious. Undertale features strategically shallow combat that is again spiced up not with funny status effects this time but with two Mario RPG-esque out-of-genre elements. The most obvious is the shoot-em-up mode, when you get attacked instead of just taking the damage you enter a small window where you control a heart dodging incoming projectiles. This is very much like Gradius or Touhou-games but I woudln&amp;rsquo;t say it tries to appeal to any of their audience. It&amp;rsquo;s less about being a compelling shoot-em-up (and it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be) but about not being a bog-standard jRPG. The shump window is Undertales equivalent to the action-commands and it even used the infamously hard nature of those shmup games as a way to create one of the most iconic bossfights in all of gaming. While the shmup section happens when you&amp;rsquo;re taking damage, when attacking Undertale takes inspiration from two other genres to advance earthbounds battle system: The first and arguably blandest one is that if you attack to deal damage you get a typical action-command, press the button at the right time to do more damage. The more other intersting one is that each battle has an entirely seperate mode in which enemies aren&amp;rsquo;t meant to be defeated by killing them but by having social interactions with them. I don&amp;rsquo;t consider the moral component of this very notable, it plainly displays the two options of killing them or sparing them in literal text on screen at all times; what the spare system offers however is a situation in which players are actively incentivized to form para-social relationship with these characters. Much like Earthbound, each chapter of Undertale is based around a certain character and as each chapter culminates in a bossfight with them that also means it culminates in a chance to get to know that chapters characters and the game runs with this, you can visit their homes, go on dates, become friends, etc.. I think this is why Undertale spawned such a dedicated fanbase, taking the mechanics of the game on it&amp;rsquo;s own merits it already literally tasks players to become a fan of Undertales characters as gameplay so of course that will result in players doing that in real life.
Undertale came out in 2015 which means that right now in 2021 we&amp;rsquo;re well past the 2-3 year development cycle of most videogames. There are and will be many games inspired specifically by Undertale and I&amp;rsquo;d like to examine what this means for the earthbound-like genre in general. Undertale was the moment where the genre exploded, LISA was succesful but did not have the reality warping success of Undertale so we&amp;rsquo;re presented with a problem: There will be games inspired by Undertale who&amp;rsquo;s devs have not played LISA or any of the games that preceeded it simply because there&amp;rsquo;s just so many more people who got into Undertale (some at a young age) exclusively. As stated above Undertale does exhibit most of the properties of earthbound-likes but I think it&amp;rsquo;s more appropriate to say it exhibits the properties of Earthbound specifically. Undertale isn&amp;rsquo;t an exploration of someones psyche, it isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly surreal or high-concept, it&amp;rsquo;s very child-friendly, has no disturbing themes or content and does a very good job at appealing to a mainstream audience much unlike most of the games (except Mario RPG) discussed here. None of these things make Undertale a worse game, I&amp;rsquo;d like to explicitely state here tha Undertale is, in fact, quite good but it means that with Undertales success the earthbound-like genre branched.
We&amp;rsquo;re now in a situation where we have games or other works of art that are &amp;lt;href=&amp;quot;https://indreams.me/search/results/?term=undertale&amp;rdquo; target=&amp;rdquo;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Undertale-clones, games that, just like Undertale did with Earthbound, exclusively try to follow Undertale and only Undertale and this may contribute to somewhat of an erasure of the genres history. We&amp;rsquo;re already feeling that shift manifesting in less than positive ways but most importantly it asks the question: are games only based on Undertale earthbound-likes? I can&amp;rsquo;t answer that question but what I can do is remind you of what my friend said when seeing a screenshot of Omori. I think what my friend meant when saying Omori looks generic is that it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s made in reaction to Undertale. Being just another Earthbound has grown stale, that&amp;rsquo;s why the genre kept evolving and adding new exciting things and games that followed the course of that lineage have managed to not be stale at all because of this. Omori is part of that lineage, it isn&amp;rsquo;t stale but people who don&amp;rsquo;t know what this somewhat obscure genre of games are capable of won&amp;rsquo;t realize this and disregard it as just another product of the explosion that was started by Undertale.
Omori is a good game, Undertale is a good game, many of Undertale successors are good games but what may not necessarily be true is that many of Undertales successors used the insight gained over decades by titles of the earthbound-genre to their full potential. Let&amp;rsquo;s do our inventory one last time:
 quirky and light-hearted world
 surreal, character-introduction-driven plot (each chapter corresponds to one party member)
 very literal plot (there are no big themes or metaphors tackled and everything that happens happens diagetically)
 shallow jRPG battle system with great presentation
 mechanics are added for flavor, not for depth
 plot suddenly shifts to very dark subject matter during the final moments
 inserts an out-of-genre system to make battle more mechanically interesting
  Hopefully you see my point.
8 An actual Definition Throughout this article we have not only looked at important games that got us to the point where we are today by inspiring each other and subsequent games but I have tried to systematically highlight things each game passed on, their &amp;ldquo;genes&amp;rdquo; so to say. If we pool these together in a set and try to find the least common denominator we can assume that this is as close to a proper definition of what I call &amp;ldquo;earthbound-likes&amp;rdquo; as we can get. So let&amp;rsquo;s do that:
A game can be considered an earthbound-like if it has enough of the following features:
a) &amp;hellip; it usually has 2D, sprite-based, low resolution, pixelart graphics
b) It is build around two distinct states, in the &amp;ldquo;overworld&amp;rdquo; the player moves through a diagetic world, usually on 2 axis, solves light puzzles and interacts with other characters by walking into them or for example talking to them or triggering the second state, &amp;ldquo;battle&amp;rdquo;, in which the player engages in an abstract representation of what diagetically is a violent fight or another form of confrontation suchs as social interactions. Note that the &amp;ldquo;battle&amp;rdquo; state can be absent completey in certain games (like Yume Nikki), the overworld part however is not optional.
c) &amp;hellip; the movement on the overworld is mechanically basic
d) &amp;hellip; there is very little strategic depth in the battle system d1) However these systems are enriched by an arbitrary out-of-genre mechanic from shoot-em-ups, fighting games, dating sims, etc. d2) The vanilla version of the battle system (the battle system without the out-of-genre gameplay) is similar to those found in early Final Fantasy, D&amp;amp;D, Dragon Quest or RPG-Maker games
e) &amp;hellip; it is directly or indirectly iterating on Mother 2: Earthbound and Notable RPG-Maker games, meaning it&amp;hellip; e1) has a world that is considered unusual compared to traditional fantasy jRPGs e2) Is very character driven, chapters or entire plothreads may revolve around meeting or introducing certain character instead instead of a driving external goal or item e3) have a quirky world that is both comedic and dramatic in writing e4) intends to be an emotionally impactful and intensely personal5 experience e5) has moments of overt horror and dark or surprisingly disturbing subject matter
f) &amp;hellip; it focuses a lot of it&amp;rsquo;s presentation on static illustration and music rather than elaborate animation or high fidelity graphics
g) &amp;hellip; it is made by a small team of either indie developers or if made by a first-party studio, developers that are usually not established for their work in other AAA successes g1) many of these developer found their footing in the Earthbound-, RPG-maker- or Undertale-community
There we have, case closed, right? You might have noticed that I used a lot of law- and math-definition tricks by using weasel words and not commiting to stating if all or even how many of these properties have to be present in a game for it to be designated as an &amp;ldquo;earthbound-like&amp;rdquo;. I consider this valid, genres aren&amp;rsquo;t a label intended to classify a piece and put it in a box and only that box, they are meant to give context to the pieces place in history and it&amp;rsquo;s inspirations and relation to other similar art. Nontheless, every single game mentioned in this article either fullfills all of these properties or came out before a time where one of it&amp;rsquo;s to-be sucessoors would introduce the missing property into the genre and have all subsequent games inherit it. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t out-of-genre mechanics before Mario RPG (there probably were games I don&amp;rsquo;t know about but you get my point), before LISA Earhtbound-likes weren&amp;rsquo;t willing to dabble with themes this explicitely disturbing (again there probably were some), you get the idea. As the genre evolved and more amazing games were made those games in turn inspired future games and the list of properties grew and grew to a point where we are today. I consider the above definition not only well-established but incredibly specific. Specific enough that some (including me) may think it should be enough to call it it&amp;rsquo;s own genre.
Either way my intention isn&amp;rsquo;t to establish a new term, what is actually important to me is for young audience members who for example got really into Undertale but none of the games mentioned here to maybe go back and try them. Don&amp;rsquo;t just emulate Earthbound and think you have the full context of even just Undertale. I&amp;rsquo;m positive anyone who liked Undertale will like the Mario RPG games, if they&amp;rsquo;re old enough I would also warmly recommend LISA. After all the actual point of putting a label on a game is to make it so, if someone likes that game, they know they should try out games in the same genre. Hopefully this article made that a little bit easier to do and I again recommend every single game mentioned by name here. I do consider all of these games at least worth your time to try and I am hopeful that in the future developers who did try them will bring us even more games that advance the genre just like all these classics.
